{"name": "Mary Ann Radcliffe", "type": "person", "abstract": "Mary Ann Radcliffe (1746 \u2013 1818) was an important British figure in the early feminist movement.", "wikipage": "Mary Ann Radcliffe (1746 \u2013 1818) was an important British figure in the early feminist movement.\nLife.\nShe was born Mary Ann Clayton in Nottingham, the elder daughter of a successful Anglican merchant James Clayton and his Catholic wife Sarah Blatherwick and christened at St Nicholas Nottingham on 18 June 1746. James Clayton was already 70 at the time of Mary Ann's birth and died when she was four. Mary Ann's sister Sarah predeceased him leaving Mary Ann as his heiress. Radcliffe was raised as a Catholic by her mother and educated at the Bar Convent in York. Mary Ann eloped to marry Joseph Radcliffe of Coxwold, Yorkshire at age 15. Initially they were married in private by a Catholic priest, but Radcliffe's guardians insisted that she be married in the Anglican Church and the marriage was conducted at St Nicholas' in Nottingham on 2 May 1762. Joseph Radcliffe seems to have been descended from the Radcliffe family of Ugthorpe Old Hall, however Mary Ann Radcliffe insists in her memoirs that he is related to the Earl of Derwentwater, a statement confirmed by a reference from Lord Traquair who states that they were \"distantly related to the Derwentwater family.\" Joseph Radcliffe's parents are described in Letter III of the memoirsof the Memoir (Edinburgh, 1810) as living in Yorkshire, and a 'good old couple' who were 'quite overjoyed' 'at seeing their only surviving son so comfortably provided for.' Mary Ann's first mention of her husband's Derwentwater ancestry occurs when she lists her sons:\n\u201cand next Joseph, so named after his father, James, in memory of my father, and the unfortunate Earl of Derwentwater, who forfeited his life in the rebellion of 1715, and Charles after the brother of the Earl of D--, who fell martyr to the same cause, in 1745, from which family I was always told, my husband was a descendent\u201d\nThe couple had eight children in quick succession, Ann, Mary Sarah, Joseph, James, Charles, Winifred and Frances. The two latter died as infants. Financial difficulties due to their growing family forced Joseph Radcliffe to invest in the sugar industry, and after unsuccessful speculations Mary Ann's inheritance was depleted. The family estates in three counties inherited from James Clayton were sold to pay Joseph's debts. From this point in 1783 Mary Ann's husband could not provide for the family. She sought positions as a housekeeper at Traquair House, governess, and in a milliner shop. With hard work she was able to put her sons, Joseph, James and Charles through school. Joseph Radcliffe Senior found work as house steward to Sir John Stanley, 6th Baronet Stanley at Alderley Park in 1783 and was not to see Mary Ann Radcliffe again. Joseph Radcliffe senior died in 1804 and Edward Stanley, son of Sir John and Bishop of Norwich was executor of his will. Mary Ann's eldest son Joseph became a merchant, her second son James a pastrycook in Holborn and her youngest son Charles after absconding from the army became a successful though minor painter who died in Salem Massachusetts in 1806.\nOf Mary Ann and her husband, William Radcliffe the Rouge Croix Pursuivant writes \"Joseph Radclyffe of Coxwold, born in 1726, married the heiress of James Clayton of Nottingham. \"Having some little fortune of his own, which was improved by that of his wife, he soon after his marriage kept a house in Grosvenor Square, with a coach and four, and kept it up as the means lasted. His widow, a clever sensible woman, kept a ready-made shoe shop, in about 1795, in Oxford Street, and is now (1810) in Edinburgh, on the bounty, I believe, of some old female acquaintance.\"\nWhile working as housekeeper at Traquair House for the Earl of Traquair and his wife, the former Mary Ravenscroft \u2013 a student with Radcliffe at the Bar Convent, Radcliffe befriended the controversial Scottish theologian Alexander Geddes. This friendship was to last until his death in 1802. Geddes encouraged her to follow her conscience, leading to her abandonment of Catholicism. This led to further estrangement from her friends and supporters and increased her difficulties in finding employment. Her Memoirs, commenced in 1807, were written to raise money after her final business venture, a pastry shop near Portobello in Scotland failed due to Mary Ann's rheumatism and failing health. By the time of the publications of her Memoirs in 1810 she was living on the charity of her friend, Mrs Ferrier of St John's Hill in Edinburgh. Ferrier and Watersons Wax Chandlers of High Street, Edinburgh were the point of sale for the book.\nMary Ann Radcliffe is often listed as having died in 1810, the date of the publication of her memoirs, however her death certificate lists her of having died of 'a decline' in 1818 in Edinburgh. She is buried in an unmarked grave in Old Calton Cemetery.\nWorks.\nRadcliffe is most famous for her book,\"The Female Advocate; or, An Attempt to Recover the Rights of Women from Male Usurpation\" (1799). This book discussed how men working in millinery and other occupations took jobs away from women forcing them to prostitution. Radcliffe's argument was framed in Christianity. She stressed how respectable women are turning to prostitution because of poverty and lack of respectable work. She argued that lack of education, societal prejudices of what a genteel woman should or should not do, hampered women from obtaining a job in a respectable establishment.\nThere is disagreement as to whether Mary Ann Radcliffe is the author of several Gothic novels attributed to her. Manfron\u00e9 was one of the most popular Gothic novels of the early nineteenth century and was remembered warmly by William Makepeace Thackeray. \u201cThe Memoirs of Mrs Mary Ann Radcliffe; in Familiar Letters to Her Female Friend\u201d complicates matters by making no reference to Mary Ann as a Gothic novelist. Other novels attributed to Mary Ann Radcliffe are Radzivil and The Fate of Velina de Guidova, both published in 1790 by William Lane at the Minerva Press. Radclife\u2019s (sic) New Novelist\u2019s Pocket Magazine appeared in 1802, a collection of fictions compiled \u201cby Mrs Mary Anne Radclife, of Wimbledon in Surrey.\u201d Certainly Radcliffe was living in Surrey around this time. Mary Ann Radcliffe states in her memoirs that it was her intention to publish all of her books anonymously however she was coerced by her publisher into publishing under her name to benefit by the similarities of her name with that of the more famous Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe.\nHer later published book, \"The Memoirs of Mrs. Mary Ann Radcliffe; in Familiar Letters to her Female Friend\" in 1810, made apparent the strong influence of her life's circumstances on her first book. The memoirs are written in a deliberately cryptic style, using initials instead of names for both places and people, however many can be identified using clues provided by Radcliffe in the text. For example while working as a companion to an elderly gentleman at R___, she mentions the house as being opposite the place where the Magna Carta was signed, identifying the place as Runnymede. The diaries of Lady Traquair are useful in providing other details of Radcliffe's life including her involvement with Alexander Geddes."}

He previously played for his hometown team the Minnesota Timberwolves for 4 seasons before signing with the Memphis Grizzlies in the 2019 offseason. He played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils in his freshman season as part of the 2014\u201315 National Championship team. He was ranked among the top 10 players in the national high school class of 2014 by Rivals.com, Scout.com and ESPN. He was a Minnesota State High School League (MSHSL) Class 4A state champion, three-time Minnesota Associated Press Boys Basketball Player of the Year and three-time Minnesota Boys Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year for Apple Valley High School. He played in the 2014 McDonald's All-American Boys Game, 2014 Jordan Brand Classic and the 2014 Nike Hoop Summit. He won the skills competition at the 2014 McDonald's All-American Game and posted the only double-double in the 2014 Jordan Brand Classic.\nHe committed to the Duke University men's basketball team as a package with Jahlil Okafor. He was a 2014 \"USA Today\" second team All-USA Boys Basketball Team selection. At Duke, he was an All-ACC third team and All-ACC Freshman first team selection. He earned NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player during Duke's victory in the championship game of the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. Subsequently, he announced he would enter the 2015 NBA draft. He was selected with the 24th overall pick by the Cleveland Cavaliers and traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves. With Minnesota he went on to set the NBA single-season assist to turnover ratio record.\nHigh school career.\nJones earned the role as a varsity starter for Apple Valley as an eighth grader for the 2009\u201310 season. That year, he averaged 16.8 points per game and 8.1 assists per game, starting every game for a team that went 20\u20138. That season he received his first recruiting letter (at age 13) from USC.\nFreshman season.\nAs a freshman, he received his first scholarship offer from Iowa. That season, he averaged 20.1 points, 7.1 assists and 2.6 steals per game in 16 games, after missing 7 weeks due to a lacerated kidney. Following his freshman season, he was invited to attend separate skills camps hosted by LeBron James and Chris Paul. However, he was also invited by USA Basketball to the United States Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs, Colorado to be one of 27 athletes try out for the 12-man FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship team, which he eventually was selected to. Team USA won the tournament. By the time he attended the July 2011 Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) Peach Jam tournament he already had offers from Minnesota and Baylor. In the days after the four-day tournament that was attended by leading coaches such as Thad Matta, Tom Izzo, Jim Boeheim, Roy Williams, John Calipari, Josh Pastner, Bill Self, Sean Miller and Rick Pitino, he received offers from Ohio State, Michigan State, Marquette, Providence, Arizona and Iowa State.\nSophomore season.\nAs a sophomore, he was a unanimous selection as the 2012 Minnesota Associated Press Player of the Year for high school boys basketball and was named to the 2012 Associated Press All-state team along with Siyani Chambers, Joey King, Tyler Vaughan and Johnny Woodard. Jones' Apple Valley team was eliminated in the MSHSL Class 4A, Section 3 final by Eastview High School. Jones averaged 28 points and 8 assists in 31 minutes per game. He earned the 2012 Minnesota Boys Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year. He was the 2012 \"Star Tribune\" Metro Player of the Year in boys' basketball as well as the \"Pioneer Press\"' boys basketball player of the year. By the end of his sophomore season, he had an offer from Duke to go along with his earlier offers from Minnesota, Iowa State, Michigan State, Ohio State, Providence, Arizona, Baylor and Marquette. Following the season, Jones again played for Team USA at the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Championship in Kaunas, Lithuania from June 29 \u2013 July 8, 2012. The team went undefeated in 8 games.\nJunior season.\nJones entered his 2012\u201313 junior season as the national class of 2014's top ranked basketball player according to ESPN. \"Sports Illustrated\" columnist Frank Burlison listed him second to Jahlil Okafor on August 16, 2012. On September 11, when Okafor was named a monthly blogger for \"USA Today\" High School Sports, he noted that he and Jones wanted to attend a Michigan State Spartans football game together. Jones was one of 10 \"USA Today\" preseason All-USA selections (along with Aaron Gordon, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, Kasey Hill, Okafor, Parker, Julius Randle, Noah Vonleh, Andrew Wiggins). At the January 5, 2013, Timberwolves Shootout at the Target Center, Jones led Apple Valley on a 31\u20139 run to overcome an 11-point deficit with 9 minutes and 19 seconds remaining against Rashad Vaughn and Robbinsdale Cooper High School. The head-to-head matchup of class of 2014 guards Jones and Vaughn was described as \"arguably the best individual-to-individual matchup in Minnesota high school basketball history\" by the \"Star Tribune\". Two weeks before the matchup of ESPN 100 top 10 high school players, NBA.com had anticipated the matchup with a feature story. Following his junior season, he was co-winner of the Minnesota Associated Press Player of the Year award for high school boys basketball, with DeLaSalle fellow junior Reid Travis. Jones led Apple Valley to the MSHSL Class 4A championship, while Travis led DeLaSalle to the 3A championship. They were joined on the Associated Press All-State team by Anders Broman, Rashad Vaughn and Graham Woodward. Jones earned the 2013 Minnesota Boys Basketball Gatorade Player of the Year and the \"Pioneer Press\" player of the year. However, Travis was the 2013 \"Star Tribune\" Metro Player of the Year in boys' basketball. Following the season, Jones was selected by HighSchoolHardwood.com as one of two juniors (along with Okafor) on its first or second five selections of its 2012-13 High School Hardwood All-American teams. Stanley Johnson was the only other junior on the 20-man All-American First Team.\nOn March 9 Jones listed his final seven schools: Baylor, Duke, Kentucky, Kansas, Michigan State, Minnesota and Ohio State. Jones had unofficially visited all seven of these schools before his junior season ended. In late April 2013, Okafor's father believed it was very possible that Okafor and Jones would matriculate together as a package. By late April, there were rumors that Cliff Alexander and Justise Winslow would attend whatever school Jones and Okafor attended.\nSenior season.\nOn May 30, Okafor cut his list of schools to eight: Arizona, Baylor, Duke, Illinois, Kentucky, Kansas, Michigan State and Ohio State, which overlapped with Jones in six schools. Although Alexander was ranked as the fifth best player in the class of 2014 by Rivals.com and had offers from four of the six schools common to both by the beginning of June, he said the chances of him matriculating with Jones and Okafor was slim. As the summer evaluation period continued, the unique nature of the possibility of Okafor and Jones, who are not related and not teammates, going to college as a package continued to get a lot of press. Jones was co-MVP for the 2013 Under Armour Elite 24 All-star game's winning team. On August 13, Jones announced that he would take official visits to four schools Baylor August 30 \u2013 September 1; Kentucky September 27\u201329; Kansas October 18\u201320; and Duke October 25\u201327. Notably, Duke, which is the favorite according to \"Star Tribune\" writer Amelia Rayno, is scheduled last. On August 14, Jones confirmed that he might make a fifth official visit (the maximum allowed by the NCAA) to Minnesota, although they remained an unlikely underdog. Okafor visited Baylor on August 29 with Jones as the two were ranked 1\u20132 in the Rivals.com class of 2014 rankings. One of the reasons Baylor was a serious contender is that Jared Nuness, a member of the Baylor basketball staff, is Jones' cousin.\nOn September 4, 2013, Rivals.com updated their ranking with Jones slipping from 2nd to 5th (behind Emmanuel Mudiay, Johnson and Alexander) and the top point guard position to second (behind Mudiay). Rivals clarified that Okafor and Jones, who are considered a package deal, had visited Baylor together and would visit both Kansas and Duke together, but that they would visit Kentucky separately. On September 13, class of 2014 point guard Tyler Ulis committed to Kentucky. Subsequently, Jones canceled his September 27\u201329 visit to Kentucky. As Okafor and Jones visited Kansas and Duke together during the last two weekends of October, those two schools were considered the favorites for the services of both. At Kansas, head coach Bill Self scheduled a second open practice for the weekend of the Okafor/Jones visit. ESPN.com's number 14 overall prospect Winslow attended Duke for an official visit the same weekend that Okafor and Jones did. At the beginning of October, rumors began that Jones and Okafor would meet in a nationally televised game on December 12 that could be the first regular season high school basketball game ever broadcast on ESPN from Minnesota. On November 15, ESPN announced the high school basketball broadcast schedule for its family of networks and the rumors were verified. On November 2, Jones reduced his list to Baylor, Kansas and Duke and was still committed to joint matriculation with Okafor.\nOn November 7 Jones was ranked fifth behind points leader Mudiay, Alexander, Okafor and Stanley Johnson in the Mr. Basketball USA preseason tracker. He had the most points of all players without any first place votes. The preseason points leader has gone on to win the award in four of the prior five years. On November 11, Jones and Okafor tweeted simultaneously that they would make simultaneous verbal commitments on November 15 from their local high schools. His verbal commitment announcement was scheduled on the same date as Alexander and Stanley Johnson. According to ESPN, all four were among the top 10 in the national class (Okafor #1, Alexander #3, Jones #4 and Johnson #9). On the eve of their announcement, Duke was the heavy favorite to land Jones and Okafor. He made his verbal commitment on ESPNU to Duke basketball on November 15. Prior to his senior season, \"USA Today\" named him to its 10-man preseason All-USA team along with Alexander, Stanley Johnson, Trey Lyles, Mudiay, Malik Newman, Okafor, Kelly Oubre, D'Angelo Russell, and Myles Turner. On November 21, Winslow committed to Duke, giving them the number one recruiting class in the nation with Jones, Okafor, Winslow and Grayson Allen all committed.\nOn December 12, Apple Valley had a 5\u20130 record (including victories over state powerhouses DeLaSalle\u2014with a sidelined Reid Travis\u2014and Hopkins) and national rankings of 41 by \"USA Today\" and 16 by MaxPreps, while Whitney Young entered the game 1\u20131 with a 34 ranking. That day, in front of Mike Krzyzewski and ESPN2's national audience, Okafor's Whitney Young beat Jones' Apple Valley 80\u201370. Okafor had 22 points and 15 rebounds, while Jones had 29 points, 5 rebounds and 6 assists. On January 4 in the Timberwolves Shootout at the Target Center, Jones led Apple Valley over the Kansas defending Class 6A champion Blue Valley High School who was ranked number 18 by \"USA Today\" at the time. On March 6, 2014, Defending state champion Apple Valley lost to Cretin-Derham Hall High School 89\u201377 in double overtime in the Class 4A Section 3 championship despite 35 points from Jones, ending his high school career.\nJones won the skills competition at the McDonald's All-American Game on March 31. In the April 2, 2014, McDonald's All-American Game Jones posted 7 points and a game-high 10 assists for the losing east team. 5 of the 7 points came in the final 2 minutes as the east briefly recovered the lead from a 99\u201395 deficit before losing 105\u2013102. On April 12, he posted a 13-point 6-assist 5-steal effort in an 84\u201373 Team USA Nike Hoops Summit victory over the world team. On April 18 in the Jordan Brand Classic, he posted the only double-double with 10 points, a game-high 12 assists and 7 rebounds.\nAwards and honors.\nJones was selected to the 10-man Team USA for the 17th annual Nike Hoop Summit on April 12, 2014 at the Moda Center. He was selected along with fellow Duke commits Okafor and Winslow. and the 24-player 37th annual April 2, 2014 McDonald's All-American Boys Game at the United Center. He was joined as a McDonald's All-American by fellow Minnesotans Reid Travis and Rashad Vaughn as well as fellow Duke commits Okafor, Winslow and Grayson Allen. On March 10 he was one of 26 players selected for the April 18, 2014 Jordan Brand Classic again along with fellow Minnesotans Travis and Vaughn as well as fellow Duke commits Okafor, Winslow and Allen. On March 17, he won Associated Press Co-Player of the Year (with J. P. Macura). On March 18, he was named as one of three finalists for the McDonald's All-American Morgan Wootten National Player of the Year (along with Stanley Johnson and Cliff Alexander). On March 20, Jones was named Minnesota Mr. Basketball. The following day he won his third consecutive Minnesota Gatorade Player of the Year Award. He was a 2014 \"USA Today\" second team All-USA Boys Basketball Team selection and a second team All-American according to MaxPreps.\nRankings and comparison.\nBy the summer after his 2010\u201311 freshman season, he was described as the best point guard from the state of Minnesota since Khalid El-Amin. Another Minnesotan who is a measuring stick for Jones is Sam Jacobson. According to Bleacher Report's Kerry Miller, when he plays for Duke, Jones is likely to finish among the top 5 in the nation in assists per game but may need to work on his defense.\nRecruiting.\nJones was one of the most sought after recruits in 2014, ranking 4th overall in ESPN's top 100, behind eventual teammate Jahlil Okafor, Myles Turner, and Cliff Alexander. He was a 2014 \"USA Today\" second team All-USA Boys Basketball Team selection. Two years prior to being recruited, Jones made a pact with Okafor to one day play at the same college together. Jones received scholarship offers from Duke, Baylor, Kentucky, Minnesota, Kansas, Michigan State, and Ohio State. Despite playing high school basketball just a short distance from the University of Minnesota\u2013Twin Cities, Jones never granted Minnesota an official visit. In 2013, Jones made official visits to Baylor on August 31, Kentucky on September 2, Kansas on October 19, and Duke on October 26. On October 31, just a few days after finishing his official visits, Jones appeared on \u00a0a radio show on WGVX-FM 105.1 Minneapolis, and listed Kansas, Baylor and Duke as his top three schools, leaving the hometown Gophers off of his list.\nShortly after, Jones and Okafor narrowed their list down to Duke and Kansas. On November 15, 2013 Jones and Okafor appeared on ESPNU to announce their decision. ESPN's Adam Finkelstein described the decision as \"making college basketball history\" with their joint commitment to the Duke University men's basketball team. Though it was thought that he might follow Jones and Okafor, Cliff Alexander announced his commitment to Kansas shortly after. On November 22, Justise Winslow announced he would join Jones and Okafor at Duke, marking the third player in ESPN's top 15 recruits to commit to Duke that year. Grayson Allen, the 21st ranked player in that class, later joined Jones, Okafor, and Winslow.\nCollege career.\nAs he entered his freshman season at Duke, he was expected to battle with senior point guard Quinn Cook and junior guard Rasheed Sulaimon for playing time following the graduation of Tyler Thornton. Well before the season there were expectations that Jones would win the starting point guard position. Thus, he was selected by \"USA Today\" to its Preseason All-American second team and by CBS Sports to its Preseason All-American third team. In its preseason top 100 player ranking, Jones was listed at number 45 by ESPN. Jones was named to the 36-man Bob Cousy Award Preseason Watch List. He was also listed as a John R. Wooden Award Preseason Top 50 candidate and a Wayman Tisdale Award Watch List selection. Jones was also included in the early December Naismith Award top 50 watch list.\nJones began the season starting alongside Cook, with Sulaimon coming off the bench. On November 14, he debuted with 15 points and 7 assists against Presbyterian. He posted 17 points against #19 Michigan State on November 18 in the 2014 State Farm Champions Classic. On November 30, Jones posted a season-high 10 assists along with 16 points for his first career double-double against Army. In the ACC\u2013Big Ten Challenge against #2 Wisconsin, Jones led the way to an 80\u201370 victory with 22 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists, which were all team highs. For his performance, Jones earned ACC Rookie of the week and Wayman Tisdale National Freshman of the Week award. He was named to the John R. Wooden Award Midseason Top 25 list on January 14. Jones tied his career high on January 19 with 22 points against Pittsburgh in Mike Krzyzewski's 999th career victory, and on January 25 he also had 22 points against St. John's in Krzyzewski's 1000th career victory. As a result of these two performances, Jones earned ACC Co-Rookies of the Week honors along with Xavier Rathan-Mayes. Jones posted a season-high tying and game-high tying 22 points as well as 8 assists against North Carolina in his first Carolina\u2013Duke rivalry game on February 18. He scored the team's final nine points in the final 1:25 of regulation to force overtime and became the first player in the rivalry to score tally 22 points, 8 assists and 7 rebounds since assists became official stats in 1983\u201384. As a result, he earned both ACC Rookie of the Week and Wayman Tisdale National Freshman of the Week recognition. On March 9, Jones earned his fourth ACC Freshman of the Week honor after a week that included a new career high with 24 points in the rematch against North Carolina on March 7.\nFollowing the 2014\u201315 Atlantic Coast Conference men's basketball season, Jones was named to the All-ACC third team and was among a trio that was the first to be selected to the All-ACC Freshman first team (along with Okafor and Winslow). He was also recognized by the Associated Press as an honorable mention selection for its All-America team. He earned NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player by scoring 23 points with 5 rebounds in the championship game of the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. In 2015, the mayor of his hometown in Apple Valley pronounced April 22 as \"Tyus Jones Day\".\nProfessional career.\nMinnesota Timberwolves (2015\u20132019).\nOn April 15, 2015, Jones announced he was ending his college career to enter the 2015 NBA draft. He was selected with the 24th overall pick in the draft by the Cleveland Cavaliers, who then traded his draft rights to his hometown team, the Minnesota Timberwolves, in exchange for a 2019 second round draft pick and the draft rights to the 31st and 36th picks in the draft, Cedi Osman and Rakeem Christmas, respectively. On July 7, 2015, he signed his rookie scale contract with the Timberwolves. Jones started in the preseason opener when Ricky Rubio was sidelined, but did not fare well against Russell Westbrook, going scoreless and nearly giving up a triple double. Jones began the season fourth on the Timberwolves depth chart at point guard (behind Rubio, Zach LaVine and Andre Miller) and was inactive for the October 28 season opener against the Los Angeles Lakers. Jones was active for the first time on November 7 when Kevin Martin had to be away from the team for the game against the Chicago Bulls. Two games later on November 10, he was active again when three starters were sidelined, including Rubio who was scratched from the lineup right before tipoff. He made his debut that night against the Charlotte Hornets, posting his first assist, steal, rebound and point. On December 5, using the flexible assignment rule, the Timberwolves assigned Jones to the Idaho Stampede, the D-League affiliate of the Utah Jazz. On December 22, he was recalled by the Timberwolves after he averaged 24.7 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.0 assists and 1.5 steals in 35.2 minutes per game in six starts in the D-League. He made his first NBA field goals on December 23 against the San Antonio Spurs, scoring 6 points in 20 minutes. Jones didn't play in 17 consecutive games (since January 4) and then had a season-high 5 assists on February 8 against the New Orleans Pelicans. By late February, head coach Sam Mitchell noted that Jones would be getting sufficient playing time to be evaluated. On February 22 he posted a career-high 9 points on 4-of-7 shooting against the Boston Celtics. On February 28, he posted 6 assists against the Dallas Mavericks. Jones posted 6 assists and 10 points against the San Antonio Spurs on March 8. On April 7, Jones tallied 4 steals against the Sacramento Kings. On April 13, he closed out the season with a 12-assist effort against the New Orleans Pelicans.\nDuring the 2016 NBA Summer League, Jones was named MVP of the league. He led Minnesota to four consecutive wins during the tournament to advance to the NBA Summer League's Championship game after losing the opening three games in Las Vegas. In seven games in Las Vegas, Jones averaged 19.4 points on 45.7 percent shooting to go with 6.3 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 1.3 steals per game. Nonetheless he began the season behind Rubio and Kris Dunn on the team depth chart. He made his season debut on November 1 with 6 assists in the Timberwolves' third game against Memphis when Rubio was lost indefinitely to a sprained elbow. On November 8, Jones posted career highs with 12 points and 5 steals as well as a career-high tying 5 rebounds to go along with a game-high 7 assists against the Brooklyn Nets. When Rubio did not play in the April 12, 2017 regular season finale against the Houston Rockets, Timberwolves point guards Kris Dunn and Jones both set new career highs with 16 assists and 17 points, respectively. Over the course of the year Jones averaged 4.2 points and 2.9 assists playing sporadically at first and then in the final 26 games.\nFollowing the 2017 NBA draft, the Timberwolves traded Dunn and LaVine away to acquire Jimmy Butler. A week later, the team traded away Rubio for a 2018 NBA draft first round selection. Thus, the 2017\u201318 Minnesota Timberwolves entered training camp with just Jones and Jeff Teague at point guard. Jones' ability to contribute was a bit of a question mark according to some. He had been perceived as slow and small previously and his defensive statistics bore that out. However, in his third year he became an above average defender statistically. When Teague was sidelined for the last four games in November, Jones averaged 11.3 points, 6.5 assists and four steals per game over 38.5 minutes. In the second of those four games, Jones posted a career-high seven steals and a career-high tying two blocked shots in his first career NBA start against the Phoenix Suns on November 26, 2017.\nOn December 17, 2018, Jones posted a 10-point/10-assist double double (the first of his NBA career) against the Sacramento Kings. Jones closed out the year on December 31 with a career-high 13-assist performance and season-high 15 points against the New Orleans Pelicans. At that point in the season, Jones was leading the NBA by a wide margin in several statistical ratios: Assist-to-turnover (6.8), steal-to-turnover (2.4) and steal-to-foul (1.4), with the former two being NBA record paces. On April 7, Jones tied his career high with 13 assists without committing a turnover against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

In his junior year, he pitched to a 7\u20130 win\u2013loss record. In Hoffman's senior year, he led Shaker High School to their first Section II Class AA title game since 2002 against town rival Colonie High School. Hoffman pitched seven shutout innings, 101 pitches and struck out nine. He struggled to be noticed by college baseball programs in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Division\u00a0I, as his fastball averaged . Hoffman pitched in Connie Mack Baseball during the offseason to attract attention from college programs, where his fastball improved to . This led to his signing a letter of intent with East Carolina University (ECU), a Division I school in Conference USA.\nCollege.\nDuring his freshman year with the East Carolina Pirates baseball team in 2012, Hoffman started 10 of the 19 games in which he appeared, posting a 3\u20132 record, one save, a 3.67 earned run average (ERA), and struck out 55 batters in innings pitched. East Carolina reached the National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I Baseball Tournament. \nDuring the 2013 season Hoffman posted a 6\u20137 record, a 3.20 ERA, led the Pirates with innings pitched and 84 strikeouts, was named to the All-Conference USA second team, and was added to the Golden Spikes Award watch list.

The Toronto Blue Jays selected Hoffman in the first round, with the ninth overall selection, and he signed with Toronto on July 2 for the full bonus slot value of $3.1\u00a0million. Though unable to pitch, Hoffman was assigned to the Rookie Gulf Coast League Blue Jays for the 2014 season. He began throwing off a mound in February 2015, and made his professional debut with the Dunedin Blue Jays of the Advanced-A Florida State League on May 20.

{"name": "Charles Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby", "type": "person", "abstract": "Brigadier-General Hon.", "wikipage": "Brigadier-General Hon. Charles Strathavon Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, (18 May 1870 \u2013 15 December 1949) was a British Army officer in the Second Boer War and World War I.\nEarly life.\nCharles Strathavon Heathcote-Drummond Willoughby (pronounced 'Hethcut-Drummond-Willowby') was born on 18 May 1870, the second son of Gilbert Henry Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby, 2nd Lord Aveland, and his wife Lady Evelyn Elizabeth Gordon, daughter of the 10th Marquess of Huntly. Lord Aveland later succeeded his mother as Lord Willougby d'Eresby, and was created Earl of Ancaster in 1892. As the younger son of a peer, Charles bore the courtesy title 'The Honourable'. The Conservative politicians Gilbert, 2nd Earl of Ancaster and Lt-Col Claud Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby were his brothers. He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge.\nMilitary career.\nIn March 1888, Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughy obtained a commission as a part-time Militia officer in the 4th Battalion Lincolnshire Regiment (Royal South Lincolnshire Militia), and then in January 1891 transferred to the Regular Army as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Scots Guards. He was promoted to lieutenant 11 August 1894, and captain on 7 June 1899. He was serving with the 2nd Battalion Scots Guards when the 2nd Boer War broke out.\nSecond Boer War.\nThe 2nd Scots Guards left Southampton on the SS \"Britannic\" in March 1900, arrived in South Africa as reinforcements the following month, and soon took part in operations in the Orange River Colony. Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby was present at the actions of Biddulphsberg and Wittenbergen. Early in 1901 he served briefly as an extra Aide-de-Camp to the British High Commissioner, Sir Alfred Milner. Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby became Adjutant of the 2nd Scots Guards in December 1901, and was present with the battalion during further operations in the Transvaal and Orange River Colony until the Boer surrender on 31 May 1902. For his service during the war he was promoted to brevet major on 22 August 1902. He left Port Natal on the SS \"Michigan\" with other men of the 2nd battalion in late September 1902, arriving at Southampton in late October, when the battalion was posted to Aldershot. He then returned to the role of Aide-de-Camp to Milner (now Lord Milner) in South Africa until the end of 1903. Returning to his regiment in London, Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby was promoted to the substantive rank of major in 1904.\nTerritorial Force.\nIn 1904 Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby was made Commandant of the School of Instruction for Officers of the Auxiliary Forces. Based at Chelsea Barracks, this provided training for the part-time officers of the Militia, Yeomanry and Volunteers. When he retired from the army in June 1908, he did not sever his military connections, but became an officer in the new Territorial Force created from the former Yeomanry and Volunteers under the Haldane Reforms. From 1908 until 1912 he was Commanding Officer of the 15th (County of London) Battalion, the London Regiment (TF). On 11 April 1912 he became commander of the 6th London Infantry Brigade with the rank of colonel (TF). The 6th London Bde comprised four South London battalions (21st\u201324th) of the London Regiment and formed part of the 2nd London Division.\nWorld War I.\nOn the outbreak of World War I, 6th London Bde was mobilised and Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby was appointed Temporary Brigadier-General. In October 1914, 2nd London Division was selected for service on the Western Front and progressive training was carried out through the winter. The division embarked for France in March 1915, concentrating round B\u00e9thune. In May the division (already known in France simply as 'The London Division' to distinguish it from the Regular Army 2nd Division) took its place in the line and was designated 47th (1/2nd London) Division, with the brigades numbered consecutively: 6th London became 142nd (1/6th London) Brigade.\nHeathcote-Drummond-Willoughby's 142 Bde carried out the division's first offensive action, on 25 May during the Battle of Festubert. The leading battalions swept across the open ground and immediately captured the German front trenches with few losses, but were then caught by enfilading fire from German artillery and suffered heavy casualties, as did the supports sent up to consolidate the gains.\nHeathcote-Drummond-Willoughby went on sick leave on 10 June 1915, and did not return to 142 Brigade.&gt; He was replaced on 14 August, but on 7 September he was appointed to command a new brigade, 120th, in 40th Division, forming at Aldershot. This was one of the last of the 'Kitchener Army' divisions to be formed, and the standard of height for infantry soldiers had been lowered in order to encourage volunteers: some of these so-called 'bantams' were well-knit, hardy men, but many others, especially in 120th Bde, were under-developed and unfit. It was estimated that the four battalions in the brigade would provide enough fit men for only two serviceable battalions. To prevent the departure of the division to the Front being indefinitely postponed, the divisional commander asked for fresh units to be drafted in. Consequently, Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby had to carry out a complete reorganisation of his command in February 1916. Divisional training was then intensified and the division was warned for overseas service in May 1916.\n40th Division disembarked in France in June 1916, and spent the whole war on the Western Front. Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby's brigade was the first part of the division to see serious action, being engaged in the Battle of the Ancre (the last phase of the Battle of the Somme, 14\u201318 November 1916), detached under the command of 31st Division.\nEarly in 1917 the division followed up the German retreat to the Hindenburg Line, with offensive action 24 April, when 120 Bde captured Villers-Plouich and Beaucamp. Villers-Plouich and over 300 prisoners were captured by 13th Bn East Surrey Regiment and Beaucamp entered by 14th Bn Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders.\nIn November 1917, during the Battle of Cambrai, the division relieved 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division to continue the breakthrough. The attack on the morning of 23 November, with the objective of capturing Bourlon Wood, was begun by 119 and 121 Bdes with tank support, while 120 Bde was in reserve. Confused fighting went on for two days and nights, with Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby feeding his troops gradually into the line. On the afternoon of 24 November 14th Bn Highland Light Infantry of 120 Bde together with some tanks attacked Bourlon village; although the HLI fought their way through the village, they became cut off on the other side. 40th Division ordered a renewed attack the following morning to break through and relieve them. The only troops available to 121 Bde for this task were the uncommitted 13th East Surreys from 120 Bde. The East Surreys attacked around dawn, made contact with the HLI battalion HQ, but were unable to get through to the HLI companies furthest forward, who were forced to surrender. In the two days the division suffered over 4000 casualties, and Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby's battalions had been badly damaged while under the command of others.\nAll brigades on the Western Front were reorganised after the heavy losses of 1917. Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby's brigade lost its English battalions and became an entirely Scottish formation as it prepared for renewed fighting in 1918. The divisional history records that 120 Brigade 'suffered a severe loss on the 15th [March 1918] when the brigade commander was sent home. General Willoughby had been in very poor health for some time, but had struggled to remain at his duty in order to see the big [German] offensive, though the delay in the opening of the attack rendered this impossible'. To the regret of his divisional commander, Heathcote\u2013Drummond-Willoughby was invalided back to the UK after two-and-a-half years in continuous command. His brigade was virtually destroyed during the subsequent German spring offensive.\nHaving been made a CMG in January 1916, Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby was awarded a CB in the New Year Honours of 1918. On demobilisation he was granted the Honorary rank of Brigadier-General on 4 March 1919.\nAfter the war he was a popular Chairman of the Turf Club in London.\nFamily life.\nHeathcote-Drummond-Willoughy married (7 January 1907) Lady Muriel Agnes Stuart Erskine, eldest daughter of the 14th Earl of Buchan. They had two children:\nBrigadier-General Hon. Charles Strathavon Heathcote-Drummond-Willoughby died on 15 December 1949. He is buried alongside many members of his family in St Michael's Churchyard, East Halton, Lincolnshire."}
{"name": "Daniel Cohn-Bendit", "type": "person", "abstract": "Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit (; ; born 4 April 1945) is a French-German politician.", "wikipage": "Daniel Marc Cohn-Bendit (; ; born 4 April 1945) is a French-German politician. He was a student leader during the unrest of May 1968 in France and was also known during that time as \"Dany le Rouge\" (French for \"Danny the Red\", because of both his politics and the colour of his hair). He was co-president of the group European Greens\u2013European Free Alliance in the European Parliament. He co-chairs the Spinelli Group, a European parliament inter-group aiming at relaunching the federalist project in Europe. He was a recipient of the European Parliament's European Initiative Prize in 2016.\nEarly life.\nCohn-Bendit was born in 1945 in Montauban, France, to German Jewish parents who had fled Nazism in 1933. He spent his childhood in Montauban. He moved to West Germany in 1958, where his father had been a lawyer since the end of the war. He attended the Odenwaldschule in Heppenheim near Frankfurt, a secondary school for children of the upper middle class. Being officially stateless at birth, when he reached the age of 14 he chose West German citizenship, in order to avoid conscription in France.\nHe returned to France in 1966 to study sociology at the University of Paris's Faculty in Nanterre under the supervision of the network society's theorist Manuel Castells. He soon joined the larger and classic nationwide anarchist federation F\u00e9d\u00e9ration anarchiste, which he left in 1967 in favour of the smaller and local Groupe anarchiste de Nanterre and the \"Noir et rouge\" magazine. Although residing in Paris, he was frequently able to travel back to West Germany, where he was notably influenced by the death of Benno Ohnesorg in 1967, and the assault on Rudi Dutschke in April 1968. In this tense context, he invited Karl Dietrich Wolff, leader of the Socialist German Student Union, for a lecture in Paris, which would prove influential to later May events.\nIn Nanterre, Cohn-Bendit was a leader in claims for more sexual freedom, with actions such as participating in the occupation of the girls' premises, interrupting the speech of a minister who was inaugurating a swimming pool in order to demand free access to the girls' dormitory. This contributed to attracting to him a lot of student supporters later to be called the '22 March Movement', a group characterised by a mixture of Marxist, sexual and anarchist ideology. In the autumn of 1967 rumours of his upcoming expulsion from the university led to a local students' strike, and his expulsion was cancelled. On 22 March 1968, students occupied the administrative offices, and the closing of the university on 2 May helped move the protests to downtown Paris.\nFrom 3 May 1968 onwards, massive student and workers riots erupted in Paris against Charles de Gaulle's government. Cohn-Bendit quickly emerged as a public face of the student protests, along with Jacques Sauvageot, Alain Geismar and Alain Krivine. His \"foreign\" origins were highlighted by opponents of the student movement, leading to students taking up the chant, \"Nous sommes tous des Juifs allemands\" (\"We are all German Jews\").\nThe French Communist Party leader Georges Marchais described Cohn-Bendit as the \"German anarchist Cohn-Bendit\" and denounced some student protesters as \"sons of the upper bourgeoisie ... who will quickly forget their revolutionary flame in order to manage daddy's firm and exploit workers there\". Continued police violence, however, prompted trade unions (and eventually the Communist Party) to support the students, and from 13 May onwards, France was struck by a general strike.\nHowever, Cohn-Bendit had already retreated on 10 May with a few friends to the Atlantic coast city of Saint-Nazaire, seeing that his Nanterre group had become a minority without political influence in the larger Paris students' movement. Cohn-Bendit's political opponents took advantage of his West German passport and had him expelled from Saint-Nazaire to West Germany on 22 May as a \"seditious alien\". On 27 May the Communist-led workers signed the Grenelle agreements with the government; on 30 May supporters of the president organised a successful demonstration; new elections were called and at the end of June 1968 the Gaullists were back in power, now occupying three-quarters of the French National Assembly.\nOn the whole, Cohn-Bendit had participated little in the May 1968 Paris events, which continued without him, but he had become a legend, which was to be used later in the 1990s upon his return to France.\nActivism.\nIn Frankfurt in the family house, Cohn-Bendit became one of co-founders of the autonomist group Revolutionary Struggle (\"Revolution\u00e4rer Kampf\") in R\u00fcsselsheim. From this point, his fate was linked with Joschka Fischer, another leader in the group. Both were later to become leaders of the Realo wing of the German Green Party, alongside many former Communist and non-Communist libertarian leftists.\nSome have suggested that the group participated in violent action, which was common in the German extreme left of the early-seventies. But testimony from witnesses appears contradictory, sometimes unreliable. Communal apartments were common on the left, and peaceful political activists could easily have shared living quarters with terrorists, without further collaboration. In 2003, a request was presented by Frankfurt prosecutors to the European Parliament, requesting they waive the immunity of MEP Cohn-Bendit, in the context of a criminal investigation against the terrorist, Hans-Joachim Klein, but the request was rejected by the assembly.\nWhile Fischer was more concerned with demonstrations, Cohn-Bendit worked in the Karl-Marx-Buchhandlung bookshop in Frankfurt and ran an anti-authoritarian kindergarten. In his 1975 book \"Le Grand Bazar\", he described himself as engaging in sexual activities with very young children at the kindergarten. In 1978, an edition of \"Pflasterstrand,\" an alternative magazine Cohn-Bendit edited, described being seduced by a 6-year-old girl as one of the most beautiful experiences the author had ever had. In 2001, Cohn-Bendit said that the accounts were invented for purposes of \"verbal provocation\", and that \"I admit that what I wrote is unacceptable nowadays\".\nJoining the Greens.\nCohn-Bendit became editor of \"Pflasterstrand\" at a time when many 'rebel' movements were petering out. The alternative magazine served as house organ to the anarchist-oriented Sponti scene in Frankfurt. There he began taking part in the environmental movement's civil agitation against nuclear energy and the expansion of the Frankfurt airport. When the Sponti movement officially accepted parliamentary democracy in 1984 he joined the German Green Party.\nIn 1988, he published, in French, \"Nous l'avons tant aim\u00e9e, la r\u00e9volution\" (In English: \"We Loved It So Much, the Revolution\"), a book full of nostalgia for the 1968 counter-culture, and announced his shift toward more centrist policies. In 1989, he became deputy mayor of Frankfurt, in charge of multicultural affairs. Immigrants made up some 30% of the city's population at that time. He also developed a more tolerant policy towards drug addicts.\nAs member of the European parliament.\nAt the 1994 European Parliament election in Germany, Cohn-Bendit was elected to the European parliament, although he had been placed only eighth on the electoral list because of his support of military intervention in Bosnia. German Greens at the time did not support the resumption of German military intervention abroad.\nAt the European elections in 1999, he re-entered French politics as the lead candidate on the list of Les Verts, the French Green Party. He found considerable support in the French media, who often feature him, even when he does not represent or is at odds with the party. He reached 9.72% of votes, a score since then unequalled by the French Greens until 2009 (16.28% of the votes), when he was again the Green lead candidate.\nIn 2002, he became joint president of the Green group in the European Parliament, together with the Italian member Monica Frassoni.\nThroughout the 1990s and 2000s, Cohn-Bendit attracted controversy for his independent views. He was criticised from the political right for being a strong proponent of freer immigration, the legalisation of soft drugs, and the abandonment of nuclear power, and from the left for his pro-free market policies, his support for military interventions in Bosnia and Afghanistan, and frequent collaboration with centrist personalities, including Bernard Kouchner and Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou. \nCohn-Bendit's disregard for conventional European politics of left and right has made him more unpopular in France than in Germany. The French Green Party and the French left in general remain more attached to these distinctions, whereas in the German Green Party, the moderate Realo wing had already won over the hard-line Fundi wing, so that possible alliances with the Conservatives were no longer taboo, and third way policies under the center-left Gerhard Schr\u00f6der government, such as Agenda 2010 and the Hartz I \u2013 IV laws, found considerable support in the corporate and financial sectors. Cohn-Bendit was also accused of not giving to the French party the percentage of his income that all MEPs and other elected members are expected to give to their party, even though the party had formally agreed to exempt him from this before his first election in France. This, alongside his pro-European attitude, led him to participate in the 2004 European elections in Germany and not France. He then became the highest-placed male candidate on the list and was elected again.\nIn 2009, Cohn-Bendit criticised Pope Benedict XVI over his comment that condoms only make AIDS worse.\nIn 2010, he was involved in founding JCall, an advocacy group based in Europe to lobby the European parliament on foreign policy issues concerning the Middle East.\nSupport for European constitution.\nIn 2003, during the Convention that prepared the text of the European constitution, Cohn-Bendit singled himself out by stating that the countries who would vote No should be compelled to hold a second referendum, and in case of a second No, should be expelled from the European Union.\nIn February 2004, in the context of the preparation of his electoral campaign and in the wider context of the final governmental drafting of the text, he led the foundation of the European Green Party in Rome. Fischer had directly participated to the drafting as German minister of foreign affairs, he was considered one of the candidates for the new role of \"European minister of Foreign Affairs\" evoked in the text, and his speech was the keynote of the event. Cohn-Bendit described the European Green Party as the first stone of European citizenship, but other commentators described this new structure as a mere adaptation of the former Federation of European Green Parties. Just as in the former structure, only delegates from national parties were allowed to vote, individual supporters were only entitled to receive information, and all other federations of European parties had to adapt their statuses later in 2004 to the new regulations from the European Commission about European political parties, in order to continue receive public funding. However, Cohn-Bendit as usual was early and energetic in presenting this innovation to the media.\nDuring this congress in Rome he also confirmed his involvement in favour of free software. He publicly confessed not understanding much about computer terms, but supported license-free software as part of a stronger market economy.\nIn 2005, he took an active part in the campaign in favour of the European constitution during the French referendum. The treaty was considered by a large part of the left as a European version of globalisation, and Cohn-Bendit became loathed by treaty opponents as one of the symbols of centre-left leaders collaborating with neo-liberalism through international institutions, along with Pascal Lamy from the Socialist Party. He also singled himself out by appearing publicly with right-wing leaders, contrarily to the tactics adopted by the Green Party and the centre-left during that campaign.\n2009 European elections.\nOn 7 June 2009, the European Parliament elections gave Cohn-Bendit a major breakthrough in France. In spite of a conservative victory by Nicolas Sarkozy's UMP Party with 27.9% of the votes and an overall conservative victory all over Europe, Europe \u00c9cologie, the coalition founded by Cohn-Bendit, won over 16.28% of the votes, trailing the French Socialist Party led by Martine Aubry (16.48%) by only 0.2%. According to official French results, Cohn-Bendit's list thus became the third political force in France, even overtaking the Socialist Party in the Paris region, and, furthermore by adding the votes of an alternative green party also present in the election, giving greens a never yet experienced weight in French politics. His list featured Franco-Norwegian Magistrate Eva Joly, a specialist of anti-corruption struggles, and Jos\u00e9 Bov\u00e9, a controversial trade unionist.\nSpinelli Group.\nOn 15 September 2010, Daniel Cohn-Bendit supported the new initiative Spinelli Group, which was founded to reinvigorate striving for federalisation of the European Union. Other prominent supporters are: Guy Verhofstadt, Jacques Delors, Joschka Fischer, Andrew Duff, Elmar Brok.\nPolitical controversy.\nOn 5 December 2008, members of the Conference of Presidents of the European Parliament, including Cohn-Bendit, visited the Czech Republic prior to the start of the Czech presidency of the European Union. They were invited by Czech President V\u00e1clav Klaus to meet him at Prague Castle. Cohn-Bendit, as chairman of Green Group, brought a European flag and presented it to Klaus. Cohn-Bendit also said that he \"did not care about Klaus' opinions on the Lisbon Treaty, that Klaus would simply have to sign it\". Cohn-Bendit also told the Czechs not to interfere with passage of the EU's climate change package. This meeting was negatively commented in the Czech Republic as an undue interference in Czech affairs. Co-president of the Independence/Democracy parliamentary group, Nigel Farage, compared Cohn-Bendit's actions to a \"German official from seventy years ago or a Soviet official from twenty years ago\".\nCohn-Bendit, a vocal supporter of Hungary's green-urban LMP party, disparaged conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n and the new Hungarian media law in a January 2011 EP meeting. Cohn-Bendit said that the new law obliterates press freedom in Hungary and called Orb\u00e1n a dictator. Orb\u00e1n responded that despite the new media law already being in force for months, Cohn-Bendit's critical words were only \"friendly baby voices\" compared to the criticism in the Hungarian media.\nAccusations of paedophilia and the defense of paedophilia.\nCohn-Bendit has been accused of defending and committing paedophilia, as he published a number of provocative statements regarding sex with children in the 1970s and early 1980s.\nHis 1975 book \"The Great Bazaar\" (\"Der grosse Basar\") where he describes sexual contact with five-year-old children during his time as a teacher in an anti-authoritarian kindergarten (). These were reiterated one year later in articles for the cultural-political magazine \"\".\nThis controversy re-surfaced in 2013: as Cohn-Bendit received the Theodor Heuss Prize, there was a rally by child-protection activists. The president of Germany's Federal Constitutional Court cited the book as grounds for his refusal to give the speech at the awards ceremony. The affair triggered wider research into the pro-pedophilia activism which prevailed in the German Green Party (without direct involvement on the part of Cohn-Bendit) well into the 1980s.\nAn article in the \"Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung\" uncovered several \"repulsive\" passages (\"absto\u00dfende Texte\") in \"Pflasterstrand\", a leftist magazine for which Cohn-Bendit was, under press law, responsible. It cited a 1978 defence of Cohn-Bendit's of this editorial practice, as well as an appearance of Cohn-Bendit in a French television talk-show in 1982 where he described a five-year-old girl undressing him as an \"eroticomaniac game\". Cohn-Bendit reacted to these allegations by claiming that his descriptions of sexual contact with pre-pubescent girls were not based on true events but were merely intended as what he today calls \"obnoxious provocation\" aimed at questioning sexual morals at the time that \"shouldn't have been written that way.\"\nBibliography.\nHe is the co-author, with his brother Gabriel Cohn-Bendit, of \"Obsolete Communism: The Left-Wing Alternative\" (\"Linksradikalismus: Gewaltkur gegen die Alterskrankheit des Kommunismus\", 1968). This book combines an account of the events of May 1968 with a critique of Stalinism, the French Communist Party and the trade union establishment. The authors acknowledged their intellectual debt to the libertarian socialist group Socialisme ou Barbarie, especially Cornelius Castoriadis (\"Pierre Chaulieu\") and Claude Lefort."}

Sheehan (born April 9, 1945) is a constitutional and public interest lawyer, public speaker, political activist and educator.\nBiography.\nOver his career, Daniel Sheehan has participated in numerous legal cases of public interest, including the \"Pentagon Papers\" case, the Watergate Break-In case, the \"Silkwood\" case, the Greensboro massacre case, the La Penca bombing case and others. He established the Christic Institute and the Romero Institute, two non-profit public policy centers. Sheehan has spoken publicly about UFOs/alien visitation and has participated in Disclosure Project events. He represents Luis Elizondo, the former director of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program in a case against the US Department of Defense. Since 2015 Sheehan has lectured on American history, politics and the assassination of John F. Kennedy at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Sheehan is currently Chief Counsel of the Romero Institute, where his focus is the Lakota People's Law Project. Sheehan and The Lakota People's Law Project participated in legal cases related to the Dakota Access Pipeline protests. In 2013 Sheehan published \"Daniel Sheehan: The People's Advocate\", a memoir, through Counterpoint Publishing.\nAt one time, Sheehan was legal counsel to the Jesuit US national headquarters in Washington, DC.\n\"Avirgan v. Hull\".\nIn 1986, the Christic Institute filed a $24 million civil suit on behalf of journalists Tony Avirgan and Martha Honey stating that various individuals were part of a conspiracy responsible for the La Penca bombing that injured Avirgan. The suit charged the defendants with illegally participating in assassinations, as well as arms and drug trafficking. Among the 30 defendants named were Iran-Contra figures John K. Singlaub, Richard V. Secord, Albert Hakim, and Robert W. Owen; CIA officials Thomas Clines and Theodore Shackley; Contra leader Adolfo Calero; Medellin cartel leaders Pablo Escobar Gaviria and Jorge Ochoa Vasquez; Costa Rican rancher John Hull; and former mercenary Sam N. Hall. \nOn June 23, 1988, United States federal judge James Lawrence King of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissed the case, stating: \"The plaintiffs have made no showing of existence of genuine issues of material fact with respect to either the bombing at La Penca, the threats made to their news sources or threats made to themselves.\" According to \"The New York Times\", the case was dismissed by King at least in part due to \"the fact that the vast majority of the 79 witnesses Mr. Sheehan cites as authorities were either dead, unwilling to testify, fountains of contradictory information or at best one person removed from the facts they were describing.\" King ordered the Christic Institute to pay $955,000 in attorneys fees and $79,500 in court costs. The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed the ruling, and the Supreme Court of the United States let the judgment stand by refusing to hear an additional appeal. The IRS stripped the Institute of its 501(c)(3) nonprofit status after claiming the suit was politically motivated. The fine was levied in accordance with Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure which can penalize lawyers for frivolous lawsuits.\nIn the wake of the dismissal, Christic attorneys and Honey and Avirgan traded accusations over who was to blame for the failure of the case. Avirgan complained that Sheehan had handled matters poorly by chasing unsubstantiated \"wild allegations\" and conspiracy theories, rather than paying attention to core factual issues."}

In 2013 she was a guest curator of the summer academy at the Zentrum Paul Klee in Bern.\nWork.\nWilliamson's work engages with themes related to memory and identity formation. Trained as a printmaker, Williamson has worked across a variety of media including archival photography, video, mixed media installations, and constructed objects. \nIn \"One Hundred and Nineteen Deeds of Sale\" (2018), the names given by slave masters, ages, sexes, and places of birth, along with the names of buyers and sellers, prices paid, and the date of purchase of people from the slave trade in India are written in black ink on cotton shirts. The shirts are imported from India, dipped into muddy waters drawn from the Cape Coast Castle, and hung around the grounds until Heritage Day, September 24, 2019. They are then taken down and returned to India, where they are washed clean and rehung as an installation at the Aspinwall House in Kochi. These people were transported by Dutch East India Company to work at the Cape Town Castle and the Company's Gardens. One Hundred and Nineteen Deeds of Sale Williamson incorporates the history and memory of the slave trade in order to transform the stigmatizing history into a history that can address and combat global inequalities. Upon opening the exhibition, Williamson read extracts of historical accounts while a woman picked up each shirt, read out the information on it, and then took it inside to be dipped in mud and hung on a washing line.

Her recent research involves these issues in addition to solidarity. She has published four single-author books and edited three academic journals, among many other publications.\nEducation and career.\nScholz received her Bachelor of Arts degree from University of Portland in 1989, with a double major in Philosophy and Theology and a minor in French. She received her Master of Arts in Philosophy in 1991 and her Ph.D. in Philosophy in 1993, both from Purdue University.\nScholz worked as a legal advocate for victims of domestic violence during her time in Indiana.

She also contributed articles to the \"Encyclopedia of Global Justice\" (2011), edited by Deen Chatterjee.\n\"Political Solidarity\".\nIn \"Political Solidarity\", Scholz argues for greater nuance in the meaning of solidarity and highlights three distinct types of solidarity: social solidarity, civic solidarity, and political solidarity. She finds all three types of solidarity importantly distinct, although they do have some unifying characteristics. Scholz goes to great efforts to avoid vagueness when discussing concepts, providing concrete articulations of concepts like 'injustice' and 'oppression,' rather than resorting to vague or demogogic treatments of such concepts. Scholz notes that effective political solidarity can only occur through a \"genuine mutually shared commitment to a cause.\" Scholz argues that political solidarity is a moral relation among humans; political solidarity with non-human animals, then, is not possible but political solidarity on behalf of nonhuman animals is. Some ecofeminists have challenged her on this point, seeking to conceptualize solidarity with non-humans. Scholz has suggested that a more fruitful approach is to think of the moral relations of social solidarity with non-human animals. "}

Robertson-von Trotha (born 22 February 1951 in Glasgow, Scotland) is a Scottish sociologist and cultural scientist, working in Germany.\nBiography and career.\nAfter the unexpected death of her father Robertson-von Trotha left Oban High School at the age of 15 without School Leaving Qualifications. In 1967 she completed her basic training in hotel management ('City &amp; Guild-Certificate') and was awarded with the gold medal of the Oban Hotel Association. \nAfter having worked in the hotel industry/sector for two years, Robertson-von Trotha began a journey as a backpacker through Europe and Turkey, which took her finally to Germany. Here she prepared herself autodidactically for the Scottish Higher Level Examinations. In 1972 she was accepted by University of Heidelberg and studied political science, sociology, philosophy and history in Heidelberg and Karlsruhe.\nWith the support of a grant from the Peter Fuld Foundation, she received her PhD in 1990 after completing a dissertation on the topic 'Ethnic Identity and Political Mobilisation'.\nIn 2004 she habilitated on 'The Dialectics of Globalisation' at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Karlsruhe. In 2007 she was appointed as an adjunct professor by the rector of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), formerly University of Karlsruhe (TH). \nShe was a founding member of the Interfacultative Institute for Cultural Studies (IAK) at the University of Karlsruhe (TH), and from 1990 to 2002 served as its managing director. Since 2002, she has been founding scientific director of the successor institution, the ZAK | Centre for Cultural and General Studies at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).\nShe is married to Klaus von Trotha, who was Minister of Science, Research and the Arts of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg from 1991 to 2001.\nResearch.\nRobertson-von Trotha's research focuses on globalisation and cultural change, multiculturalism and integration policy, cultural heritage, and the 'Theory and Practice of Public Science' (\"\u00d6ffentliche Wissenschaft\").\nIn her opening speeches to the 'Karlsruher Dialogues' Robertson-von Trotha introduced the concept of Public Science, redesigning the classical task of science communication and dissemination of scientific processes and findings according to dialogical and transdisciplinary principles. She was the first to introduce the term in German speaking space, as well as an advising expert and one of the first signatories of the \"Charta \u00d6ffentliche Kommunikationswissenschaft\" ('Public Communication Science').\nThis approach had been inspired by the tradition of the British 'PUS Initiative' ('Public Understanding of Science') and the promotion of the 'Understanding of Scientific literacy' developed in North America. \nSubsequently, Robertson-von Trotha developed her concept in relation to the PUSH-Memorandum of the non-profit company \"Wissenschaft im Dialog\" (WiD), founded in 1999, an initiative of the \"Stifterverband f\u00fcr die Deutsche Wissenschaft\" ('Donors' Association for the Promotion of Sciences and Humanities in Germany'), and in 2012 she carried out the first of several analyses of Public Science \"in the mirror of Web 2.0 culture\".\nAs founding director of the ZAK | Centre for Cultural and General Studies, she also institutionally established her programme of 'Public Science in Theory and Practice': in addition to Research and Teaching, it forms one of the three pillars on which the centre is based on.\nFields of activity.\nCaroline Y. Robertson-von Trotha's multifaceted commitment is characterized by a combination of theoretical and practical approaches. One of her central issues is the mediation between science and society, with a focus on international and intercultural contexts, interdisciplinarity, and critical reflection. \nConceptual activity.\nShe developed her core concept, 'Public Science' (\u00d6W), within the framework of the Interfacultative Institute for Cultural Studies (IAK), which she had co-founded in 1989. The main aim was to raise public awareness of the importance of science and thus enable an exchange in the sense of an encompassing civil society. Key conceptual terms include 'Scientific/Cultural Literacy' and 'Scientist Citizen/Citizen Scientist'. In the process, especially later on as founding director of the ZAK, she conceived various and diverse formats which represent possibilities for practical implementation of her theory of 'Public Science': Following the 'Karlsruhe Dialogues' (since 1997), these are above all the further development of the 'Colloquium Fundamentale' (since winter semester 2002/2003), the 'Jean Monnet Keynote Lectures' (since summer semester 2008), the 'City Conversations' (since 2015) and, since winter semester 2016/2017, the 'Science Dialogues' and the 'World Science Caf\u00e9'.\nAnalogous to her integrative approach in the field of science communication, Robertson-von Trotha researches and is involved in the field of socio-political integration. In her early publications in the late 1980s and early 1990s, she developed themes and theses on multiculturalism and integration which have become increasingly important for research and politics since the turn of the millennium. In her dissertation of 1991, for example, she describes in detail how ethnic identity can be used for mobilization for various political goals and the dangers this entails. At first it is the German sociologist and political scientist Alf Mintzel, for example, who recognizes Robertson-von Trotha's work as a contribution to research on ethnic identities as a \"central theorem\".\nAccordingly, in 2011, she was significantly involved as scientific consultant and co-author in drafting the strategy paper 'Alliance for Integration' of the Stuttgart City Council, which was awarded the Cities for Peace Prize by UNESCO in 2004; and in 2016 she introduced in cooperation with the International Scholars &amp; Welcome Office (IScO) at KIT and within the framework of the Philipp Schwartz Initiative, supported by the German Federal Foreign Office and others, the 'World Science Caf\u00e9', where refugees report on their scientific work.\nCuratorial and editorial activities.\nIn addition to curating her own format concepts such as the 'Karlsruhe Dialogues', since 2012, Robertson-von Trotha is currently responsible for the coordination of the German network of the Anna Lindh Foundation (Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures).\nShe has been head of various research projects, including the DFG project 'InsideScience \u2013 Public Science in Collaborative Research Projects' (2010-2012) and 'The Interdisciplinary Centre for Digital Tradition' (CODIGT) (2011-2016).\nRobertson-von Trotha is the editor of three scientific series: 'Kulturwissenschaft interdisziplin\u00e4r/Interdisciplinary Studies on Culture and Society' (published by Nomos in Baden-Baden), \"Problemkreise der Angewandten Kulturwissenschaft\", and \"Kulturelle \u00dcberlieferung \u2013 digital\" (published by KIT Scientific Publishing in Karlsruhe).\nOffices and Memberships.\nCaroline Y. Robertson-von Trotha holds several offices and is a member of various boards of trustees and committees: Since 2009, she is a member of the Culture Committee of the German UNESCO Commission (from 2009 until 2011 Vice-Chairwoman), since 2011, Deputy Chairwoman of the Humboldt Regional Group Karlsruhe-Pforzheim e.V. and since 2013, chairwoman of the Academic Council for Culture and Foreign Policy (WIKA) at the Institute for Foreign Cultural Relations (ifa) in Stuttgart/Berlin, where she is also a member of the Research Advisory Board. Since 2014, she is a member of the Scientific Committee of the Anna Lindh Foundation Report.\nIn addition, she was active for/within the KIT as spokesperson in several KIT competence areas, like \"Mensch und Technik\" ('People and Technology'), \"Technik, Kultur und Gesellschaft\" ('Technology, Culture and Society'), and \"Kulturerbe und sozialer Wandel\" ('Cultural Heritage and Social Change').\nSince 1995, she is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Institute for Cultural Policy of the \"Kulturpolitische Gesellschaft e.V.\", as well as founding member of the \"Kulturwissenschaftliche Gesellschaft e.V.\" (2015); since 2017, she is member of the Scientific Advisory Board (\"Kleines Konvent\") of the Schader Foundation and member of the \"Netzwerk Integrationsforschung\" ('Network Integration Research') of the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Ministry for Integration.\nShe was also appointed to the impromptu EU Focus Working Group on Science and Culture in 2009, and is also a reviewer for the EU, the MWK (Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) and the BMBF (Federal Ministry of Education and Research).\nJune 2021: Caroline Y.

In 1995 Fudenberg's medical license was suspended for improperly obtaining controlled substances.\nEducation.\nHe received his A.B. from UCLA in 1949 and his MD from the University of Chicago in 1953. Fudenberg received his M.A. in immunochemistry from Boston University in 1957.\nCareer.\nThe areas of his research, conducted primarily in the 1960s and 1970s, included research into immunoglobulin and receptors for this molecule in human monocytes, as well as the ability of red blood cells to, in vitro, form \"rosette\" formations around peripheral blood lymphocytes.\nFudenberg was hired by the Special Projects Unit of the Council for Tobacco Research in 1972, to study whether some people are genetically predisposed to emphysema. He initially found that up to 10% might be, and was planning on warning such people not to smoke tobacco, but his funding was cut off without explanation before he could do so. \"They may have cut me off because it would have been negative for them,\" Fudenberg suggested.\nHe trained from 1954 to 1956 under William Dameshek, former editor of \"Blood\" and completed a residency at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital from 1956 to 1958.

In 1974, he relocated to South Carolina, specifically the Medical University of South Carolina, where he remained as a professor until 1989.\nMMR vaccine controversy.\nIn the 1980s Fudenberg began saying the MMR vaccine causes autism; a fringe position which led to the MMR vaccine controversy. Scientific consensus concludes that no evidence links the vaccine to the development of autism and that the vaccine's benefits greatly outweigh its risks. Fudenberg published his research in the fringe journal \"Biotherapy\" (now discontinued) in 1996, concluding that \"Fifteen of the [True Autism] patients developed symptoms within\na week after immunization with the [MMR] vaccine\"; further asserting that \"Fudenberg healed children, with a quarter 'fully normalised'.\" This paper was cited by Andrew Wakefield's fraudulent 1998 Lancet paper. The proposal of a vaccine-autism link has been called \"the most damaging medical hoax of the last 100 years\".\nFudenberg stated in a 2004 interview with Brian Deer he was able to cure autistic children using his own bone marrow. Fudenberg was a co-inventor of the autism \"treatments\" Wakefield obtained a patent for in 1997, and Wakefield stated the same year in a letter to the bursary of Royal Free Hospital's School of Medicine that he was waiting on a business plan from NITRF.\nFlu vaccine controversy.\nIn a 2005 episode of \"Larry King Live\" in which Bill Maher was being interviewed by Larry King, Maher argued that \"if you have a flu shot for more than five years in a row, there's ten times the likelihood that you'll get Alzheimer's disease.\" This claim has been traced by David Gorski back to Fudenberg; Gorski noted that it appeared on what he called an \"\u00fcber-crank\" web-site. Specifically, it appears Fudenberg made the claim when speaking at the 1st annual International Public Conference on Vaccination, held by the National Vaccine Information Center in Arlington, Virginia in 1997. The origin of the claim is unknown, as there is no study published in a peer-reviewed journal making such a claim. Furthermore, one study found that past exposure to influenza vaccines is associated with lower risk for Alzheimer's disease.\nLicense revocation.\nIn 1995 Fudenberg's medical license was revoked. The Casewatch website states: \"the South Carolina medical board found Fudenberg \"guilty of engaging in dishonorable, unethical, or unprofessional conduct,\" fined him $10,000, ordered him to surrender his license to prescribe controlled substances (narcotic drugs), and placed his license on indefinite suspension.\" The board found that:The Respondent admitted that he has on numerous occasions obtained controlled substances and legend drugs, namely, prosom, ambien, lasix, and potassium from a member of his office staff and others, and that he has unlawfully obtained these controlled substances for his own use, and has, in fact, used these medications. In an interview with \"The Post and Courier\", Fudenberg contended that \"alcohol and opiate charges are completely false\" and tried to attribute many of the problems to a former staff member at NITRF.\nDeath.\nOn March 15, 2014, Fudenberg died at the age of 85. He was survived by his four sons; including the economist Drew Fudenberg."}

{"name": "Palestinian Arabic", "type": "dialect", "abstract": "Palestinian Arabic is a dialect continuum of mutually intelligible varieties of Levantine Arabic spoken by most Palestinians in Palestine, Israel and in the Palestinian diaspora.", "wikipage": "Palestinian Arabic is a dialect continuum of mutually intelligible varieties of Levantine Arabic spoken by most Palestinians in Palestine, Israel and in the Palestinian diaspora. Together with Jordanian Arabic, it has the ISO 639-3 language code \"ajp\", known as South Levantine Arabic.\nPalestinian Arabic is the closest Arabic dialect to Modern Standard Arabic.\nFurther dialects can be distinguished within Palestine, such as spoken in the northern West Bank, that spoken by Palestinians in the Hebron area, which is similar to Arabic spoken by descendants of Palestinian refugees living in Jordan and south-western Syria.\nHistory.\nThe variations between dialects probably reflect the different historical steps of Arabization of Palestine.\nPrior to their adoption of the Arabic language from the seventh century onwards, the inhabitants of Palestine predominantly spoke Jewish Palestinian Aramaic (as witnessed, for example, in Palestinian Jewish and Palestinian Christian literature), as well as Greek (probably in the upper or trader social classes), and some remaining traces of Hebrew. At that time in history, Arabic-speaking people living in the Negev desert or in the Jordan desert beyond Zarqa, Amman or Karak had no significant influence.\nArabic-speaking people such as the Nabataeans tended to adopt Aramaic as a written language as shown in the Nabataean language texts of Petra. Jews and Nabataeans lived side by side in Mahoza and other villages, and their dialects of what they would both have thought of as \u201cAramaic\u201d would almost certainly have been mutually comprehensible. Additionally, occasional Arabic loan can be found in the Jewish Aramaic documents of the Dead Sea Scrolls.\nThe adoption of Arabic among the local population occurred most probably in several waves. After the Arabs took control of the area, so as to maintain their regular activity, the upper classes had quickly to get fluency in the language of the new masters who most probably were only few. The prevalence of Northern Levantine features in the urban dialects until the early 20th century, as well as in the dialect of Samaritans in Nablus (with systematic imala of /a:/) tends to show that a first layer of Arabization of urban upper classes could have led to what is now urban Levantine. Then, the main phenomenon could have been the slow countryside shift of Aramaic-speaking villages to Arabic under the influence of Arabized elites, leading to the emergence of the rural Palestinian dialects. This scenario is consistent with several facts.\nDifferences compared to other Levantine Arabic dialects.\nThe dialects spoken by the Arabs of the Levant \u2013 the Eastern shore of the Mediterranean \u2013 or Levantine Arabic, form a group of dialects of Arabic. Arabic manuals for the \"Syrian dialect\" were produced in the early 20th century, and in 1909 a specific \"Palestinean Arabic\" manual was published.\nThe Palestinian Arabic dialects are varieties of Levantine Arabic because they display the following characteristic Levantine features:\nThe noticeable differences between southern and northern forms of Levantine Arabic, such as Syrian Arabic and Lebanese Arabic, are stronger in non-urban dialects. The main differences between Palestinian and northern Levantine Arabic are as follows:\nThere are also typical Palestinian words that are shibboleths in the Levant. \nSocial and geographic dialect structuration.\nAs is very common in Arabic-speaking countries, the dialect spoken by a person depends on both the region he/she comes from, and the social group he/she belongs to.\nPalestinian urban dialects.\nThe Urban ('madani') dialects resemble closely northern Levantine Arabic dialects, that is, the colloquial variants of western Syria and Lebanon.&lt;ref name=\"Sociolinguistics/Soziolinguistik 3: An International Handbook\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This fact, that makes the urban dialects of the Levant remarkably homogeneous, is probably due to the trading network among cities in the Ottoman Levant, or to an older Arabic dialect layer closer to the qeltu dialects still spoken in Upper Mesopotamia.\nUrban dialects are characterised by the [\u0294] (hamza) pronunciation of \u0642 qaf, the simplification of interdentals as dentals plosives, i.e. \u062b as [t], \u0630 as [d] and both \u0636 and \u0638 as [d\u02e4]. Note however that in borrowings from Modern Standard Arabic, these interdental consonants are realised as dental sibilants, i.e. \u062b as [s], \u0630 as [z] and \u0638 as [z\u02e4] but \u0636 is kept as [d\u02e4]. The Druzes have a dialect that may be classified with the Urban ones, with the difference that they keep the uvular pronunciation of \u0642 qaf as [q]. The urban dialects also ignore the difference between masculine and feminine in the plural pronouns \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0648 ['\u026antu] is both 'you' (masc. plur.) and 'you' (fem. plur.), and ['h\u028amme] is both 'they' (masc.) and 'they' (fem.)\nRural varieties.\nRural or farmer ('fallahi') variety is retaining the interdental consonants, and is closely related with rural dialects in the outer southern Levant and in Lebanon. They keep the distinction between masculine and feminine plural pronouns, e.g. \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0648 ['\u026antu] is 'you' (masc.) while \u0627\u0646\u062a\u0646 ['\u026ant\u026an] is 'you' (fem.), and \u0647\u0645\u0647 ['h\u028amme] is 'they' (masc.) while \u0647\u0646\u0647 ['h\u026anne] is 'they' (fem.). The three rural groups in the region are the following:\nBedouin variety.\nThe Bedouins of Southern Levant use two different ('badawi') dialects in Galilee and the Negev. The Negev desert Bedouins, who are also present in Palestine and Gaza Strip use a dialect closely related to those spoken in the Hijaz, and in the Sinai. Unlike them, the Bedouins of Galilee speak a dialect related to those of the Syrian Desert and Najd, which indicates their arrival to the region is relatively recent. The Palestinian resident Negev Bedouins, who are present around Hebron and Jerusalem have a specific vocabulary, they maintain the interdental consonants, they do not use the \u0634-[-\u0283] negative suffix, they always realise \u0643 /k/ as [k] and \u0642 /q/ as [g], and distinguish plural masculine from plural feminine pronouns, but with different forms as the rural speakers.\nCurrent evolutions.\nOn the urban dialects side, the current trend is to have urban dialects getting closer to their rural neighbours, thus introducing some variability among cities in the Levant. For instance, Jerusalem used to say as Damascus ['n\u026a\u0127na] (\"we\") and ['h\u028anne] (\"they\") at the beginning of the 20th century, and this has moved to the more rural ['\u026a\u0127na] and ['h\u028amme] nowadays. This trend was probably initiated by the partition of the Levant of several states in the course of the 20th century.\nThe Rural description given above is moving nowadays with two opposite trends. On the one hand, urbanisation gives a strong influence power to urban dialects. As a result, villagers may adopt them at least in part, and Beduin maintain a two-dialect practice. On the other hand, the individualisation that comes with urbanisation make people feel more free to choose the way they speak than before, and in the same way as some will use typical Egyptian or Lebanese features as [le:] for [le:\u0283], others may use typical rural features such as the rural realisation [k\u02e4] of \u0642 as a pride reaction against the stigmatisation of this pronunciation.\nSpecific aspects of the vocabulary.\nAs Palestinian Arabic is spoken in the heartland of the Semitic languages, it has kept many typical semitic words. For this reason, it is relatively easy to guess how Modern Standard Arabic words map onto Palestinian Arabic Words. The list (Swadesh list) of basic word of Palestinian Arabic available on the Wiktionary (see \"external links\" below) may be used for this. However, some words are not transparent mappings from MSA, and deserve a description. This is due either to meaning changes in Arabic along the centuries - while MSA keeps the Classical Arabic meanings - or to the adoption of non-Arabic words (see below). Note that this section focuses on Urban Palestinian unless otherwise specified.\nPrepositional pseudo verbs\nThe words used in Palestinian to express the basic verbs 'to want', 'to have', 'there is/are' are called prepositional pseudo verbs because they share all the features of verbs but are constructed with a preposition and a suffix pronoun.\nIn the perfect, they are preceded by \u0643\u0627\u0646 [ka\u02d0n], e.g. \"we wanted\" is \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u062f\u0646\u0627 [ka\u02d0n 'b\u026addna].\nRelative clause\nAs in most forms of colloquial Arabic, the relative clause markers of Classical Arabic (\u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0630\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0644\u062a\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 and \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u062a\u064a) have been simplified to a single form \u0625\u0644\u0644\u064a ['\u0294\u026alli].\nInterrogatives pronouns\nThe main Palestinian interrogative pronouns (with their Modern Standard Arabic counterparts) are the following ones.\nNote that it is tempting to consider the long [i\u02d0] in \u0645\u064a\u0646 [mi\u02d0n] 'who?' as an influence of ancient Hebrew \u05de\u05d9 [mi\u02d0] on Classical Arabic \u0645\u0646 [man], but it could be as well an analogy with the long vowels of the other interrogatives.\nMarking Indirect Object\nIn Classical Arabic, the indirect object was marked with the particle /li-/ ('for', 'to'). For instance 'I said to him' was \u0642\u0644\u062a \u0644\u0647 ['qultu 'lahu] and 'I wrote to her' was \u0643\u062a\u0628\u062a \u0644\u0647\u0627 [ka'tabtu la'ha:]. In Palestinian Arabic, the Indirect Object marker is still based on the consonant /l/, but with more complex rules, and two different vocal patterns. The basic form before pronouns is a clitic [\u026all-], that always bears the stress, and to which person pronouns are suffixed. The basic form before nouns is [la]. For instance\nBorrowings\nPalestinians have borrowed words from the many languages they have been in contact with throughout history. For example,\nPalestinians in the Palestinian territories sometimes refer to their brethren in Israel as \"the b'seder Arabs\" because of their adoption of the Hebrew word \u05d1\u05b0\u05bc\u05e1\u05b5\u05d3\u05b6\u05e8 [beseder] for 'O.K.', (while Arabic is \u0645\u0627\u0634\u064a[ma:\u0283i]). However words like 'traffic light' and 'roadblock' have become a part of the general Palestinian vernacular.\nThe 2009 film \"Ajami\" is mostly spoken in Palestinian-Hebrew Arabic.\nInterpretations of \"Arabrew\" are often colored by non-linguistic political and cultural factors, but how contact with Hebrew is realized has been studied, and has been described in linguistic terms and in terms of how it varies. \"Arabrew\" as spoken by Palestinians and more generally Arab citizens of Israel has been described as classical codeswitching without much structural effect While the codeswitching by the majority of Arab or Palestinian citizens of Israel who are Christian or Muslim from the North or the Triangle is described as limited, more intense codeswitching is seen among Arabs who live in Jewish-majority settlements as well as Bedouin (in the South) who serve in the army, although this variety can still be called codeswitching, and does not involve any significant structural change deviating from the non-Hebrew influenced norm. For the most part among all Christian and Muslim Arabs in Israel, the impact of Hebrew contact on Palestinian Arabic is limited to borrowing of nouns, mostly for specialist vocabulary, plus a few discourse markers. However, this does not apply to the Arabic spoken by the Israeli Druze, which has been documented as manifesting much more intense contact effects, including the mixture of Arabic and Hebrew words within syntactic clauses, such as the use of a Hebrew preposition for an Arabic element and vice versa, and the adherence to gender and number agreement between Arabic and Hebrew elements (i.e. a Hebrew possessive adjective must agree with the gender of the Arabic noun it describes). While Hebrew definite articles can only be used for Hebrew nouns, Arabic definite articles are used for Hebrew nouns and are, in fact, the most common DP structure.\nVowel harmony.\nThe most often cited example of vowel harmony in Palestinian Arabic is in the present tense conjugations of verbs. If the root vowel is rounded, then the roundness spreads to other high vowels in the prefix. Vowel harmony in PA is also found in the nominal verbal domain. Suffixes are immune to rounding harmony, and vowels left of the stressed syllable do not have vowel harmony.\nPalestinian Arabic has a regressive vowel harmony for these present tense conjugations: if the verb stem's main vowel is /u/, then the vowel in the prefix is also /u/, else the vowel is /i/. This is compared with standard Arabic (which can be seen as representative of other Arabic dialects), where the vowel in the prefix is consistently /a/.\nExamples:\nPublications.\nThe Gospel of Mark was published in Palestinian Arabic in 1940, with the Gospel of Matthew and the Letter of James published in 1946."}

Fishelson (1914\u20131991) was an entrepreneur, inventor and college professor. David Fishelson attended Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts (class of 1974), and the University of Wisconsin-Madison (class of 1978) \u2014 where his mentor was film scholar David Bordwell \u2014 before attending one year of graduate school at the (1978\u201379). In Paris, in 1978, he met Zoe Zinman, who would become his collaborator on the feature film \"City News\" (1983). After Paris, he moved to New York City in 1979.\nCareer.\nThe eighties, \"City News\", PBS' \"American Playhouse\".\nFrom 1979 to 1983, Fishelson worked as a production assistant in the film and television industry in New York, while writing and directing the feature film \"City News\" with Zinman. Shot on a small budget, \"City News\" found success in 1983-4 by being selected for the Film Festivals of Atlanta, Edinburgh, Houston, Munich, Florence, Athens, Santa Fe, Seattle, Vancouver, Dallas, G\u00f6teborg and Antwerp \u2014 winning \"Best Dramatic Film\" at Atlanta, \"Best Low-Budget Feature\" at Houston, and \"Best Feature (Narrative)\" at Athens. After its tour of festivals, \"City News\" was exhibited in U.S. theaters by film distributor Cinecom Pictures, and was nationally broadcast on the third season (1984) of the PBS television series \"American Playhouse\". By 1989, \"City News\" had been curated for the permanent collection of the Museum of Television &amp; Radio, as well as listed in the American Film Institute's Catalog of Feature Films.\nThe nineties, Cocteau Rep, NPR, plays published.\nIn 1989, Fishelson joined the staff of the Off-Broadway repertory theatre company Jean Cocteau Repertory (a.k.a. \"The Cocteau\", founded 1973), located on the Bowery (NYC) at the Bouwerie Lane Theatre. Fishelson was the Cocteau's executive director from 1989\u20131992, its associate artistic director from 1992\u20131994, and a resident director there from 1994\u20131997, where he wrote and directed dramatizations of two novels by Fyodor Dostoyevsky: \"The Idiot\" and \"The Brothers Karamazov\". Following reviews in \"The New York Times\", both plays were published by Dramatists Play Service (1995). In 1994 and 1997, they were broadcast as radio plays \u2013 with Fishelson directing both \u2013 on the NPR series \"National Public Radio Playhouse\", starring Ed Asner, Sharon Gless and Harry Hamlin among others. Both dramatizations remain in circulation (in written and audio/radio drama format), and both continue to be produced worldwide, including (in the 2000s) runs at Copenhagen's Royal Danish Theatre (2006), as well as the Aarhus Theatre (2007). Following both plays' publication, Fishelson became a member of the Dramatists Guild of America.\nThe 2000s and 2010s, MET, \"Hank\" and \"Golda\", Broadway and touring, \"9 Parts\", Golda as film.\nIn 1999, Fishelson founded his own theater company \u2013 the nonprofit, 140-seat, Off-Broadway \"Manhattan Ensemble Theatre\" (\"MET\") \u2014 with a stated mission \"to create new theatrical adaptations of stories found in fiction, journalism, film, biography and memoir.\" From 1999\u20132007, Fishelson's MET featured several well-known stars in its productions, including Jim Parsons (CBS's \"The Big Bang Theory\"), Mireille Enos (AMC's \"The Killing\"), Robert Prosky (NBC's \"Hill Street Blues\"), Valerie Harper (CBS's \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\"), and Tovah Feldshuh (NBC's \"Holocaust\"). Among Fishelson's nine shows from 1999\u20132007 were two of his own plays: an adaptation of the Yiddish play \"The Golem\"; and his dramatization of Franz Kafka's unfinished novel \"The Castle\". For the latter, Fishelson was nominated in 2002 for \"Best Off-Broadway Play\" by the Outer Critics Circle, as well as for \"Best Play\" by the Drama League (each time as writer and producer). With the publication of \"The Golem\" and \"The Castle\" in 2003, Fishelson had four published plays to his name.\nFishelson's 2003\u20134 season saw frequent transfers of his shows from MET's 140-seat, SoHo-based home, as described in \"Playbill\":\nWith \"Golda's Balcony\" (which opened at the Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway on Oct. 15), MET has two hits based on the lives of renowned historical figures. Its first offering this season, \"Hank Williams: Lost Highway\", about the troubled country singer and composer, was hailed and quickly transferred following an extended run. It is currently playing the Little Shubert Off-Broadway. (In fact, the runaway success of MET's first two shows caused the nonprofit to postpone its third selection until the (2004\u201305) season.)\nBefore transferring, \"Lost Highway\" earned positive reviews in the New York press and multiple theatre award nominations, including two for Fishelson in the \"Best Musical\" and \"Best Off-Broadway Musical\" categories. \"Rolling Stone\" critic and editor Anthony DeCurtis wrote \"I was genuinely surprised, even stunned by [MET's version of] \"Hank Williams: Lost Highway\"... a rare achievement in any musical theater that I've ever seen\u201d; while Jeremy McCarter of \"New York Magazine\" called Fishelson's production \"electrifying\", \"the most successful jukebox musical I've seen,\" and \"New York's most exciting new musical since \"Urinetown\".\"\nFishelson's three subsequent mountings of \"Golda's Balcony\", the one-woman show about Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir, earned nominations and awards in each of its manifestations, including Off-Broadway (a 4-month sold-out run at the MET SoHo space), on Broadway (starring Tovah Feldshuh), and the 9-month \"National Tour\" of the U.S. and Canada (starring Valerie Harper).

{"name": "Carl G.

Additionally he is Chief Scientist at Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust, and an honorary professor in ecology and conservation biology at the University of East Anglia. Often outspoken on the importance of knowing your species and using intuition, empathy and practical knowledge over dogmatic education, Jones is best known for his work in recovering the Mauritius kestrel (Falco punctatus) from just four individuals in 1974, to an estimated 400. Working in the Mascarene Islands since 1979, Jones has led five successful bird restoration projects where the starting population has numbered less than 12 individuals; as a consequence Mauritius has averted more bird extinctions than any other country. Jones has pioneered the use of ecological or taxon replacements to fill the ecological roles of extinct animals and successfully restored levels of endemic vegetation to previously denuded islets. Jones' work has been highlighted in Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine's 1990 radio documentary \"Last Chance to See\", along with its accompanying book, as well as David Quammen's 1996 book \"The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinctions\".\nEarly life.\nJones was born in Carmarthen, Wales in 1954. During his youth he was fascinated with animals, and bred kestrels in his back yard. He credits both his initial excitement and subsequent success in restoring the Mauritius kestrel to the experience gathered during this time. Speaking of his decision to pursue conservation as a career, Jones has stated: \n Subsequently, he has spent his career conserving and studying species and systems and helping others to become conservation biologists.\nEducation.\nCarl went to Queen Elizabeth I Grammar School for boys, Carmarthen. He did his BSc at the North-East London Polytechnic. In 1978 Jones began his master's degree at University of Wales, Swansea. Initially studying developmental strategies in owls, the opportunity to run the conservation project in Mauritius saw him change the title of his research to \"Studies on the Biology of the Critically Endangered Birds of Mauritius\" From these studies he began to formulate a strategy to conserve the most endangered avifauna in his project region. After completing his MSc, he completed a PhD, also at Swansea, studying the pink pigeon (\"Nesoenas mayeri)\".\nMauritius and Mascarene Islands.\nJones started working in Mauritius in 1979, whilst working for the International Council for Bird Preservation (now known as Birdlife International). Upon arrival, Jones' focus was to run and establish the captive breeding project and to work on the conservation of the most threatened species in the wild. Carl worked on the pink pigeon and the Mauritius kestrel (\"Falco punctatus\"), which was considered the world's rarest bird. The species had reached an all-time low in 1974 with only four known wild birds. Despite the prevailing opinion that \"F. punctatus\" was doomed to extinction, he took over the recovery project that had been initiated in 1973 and began to implement captive breeding techniques such as \"double-clutching\", which is the removal of the first clutch of eggs (for captive rearing) which encourages the birds to lay a second clutch, thereby increasing the fecundity of breeding pairs, along with dietary supplementation for parents, fostering of captive reared young to wild pairs and hacking of captive raised birds to ensure maximum recruitment of juvenile birds. Between 1983 and 1993, 333 Mauritius kestrels had been reared, a third of these were captive bred and the remainder were derived from wild harvested eggs, most of these were returned to the wild. The Mauritius kestrel has subsequently been down-listed from Critically Endangered in the late 1970s, to Endangered in 1994 and Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List by 2000.\nDuring the 1970s, the Mauritius parakeet (\"Psittacula echo\"), the only surviving parrot species endemic to Mauritius and the Mascarenes, had suffered huge losses due to competing invasive species, predation from introduced mammals and loss of native trees in which to nest. By the early 1980s there were thought to be around 10 Mauritius parakeets left, with precious little recruitment throughout the decade. Whilst speaking at a 1990 captive breeding conference, Jones told delegates that the echo parakeet had a perilously low population and would likely become extinct, not for lack of expertise, but because attempts at gaining funding for the necessary actions had been fruitless. Mike Reynolds of the Parrot Trust approached Jones after the presentation, and the resultant collaboration brought much needed funds and veterinary expertise to the assistance of the species restoration project. Under Jones' guidance, nest boxes were placed in the forest, treatments to dissuade tropical nest flies from attacking the young in the nest and supplementary feeding for breeding pairs, and by 2005, 139 birds had been released. By 2015, there was a population of about 650 birds, and the species had been down-listed from Critically endangered to Endangered in 2007.\nFurther species restoration work was undertaken with the pink pigeon (\"Nesoenas mayeri\"), of which the population had declined to just 10 individuals by 1990. Population estimates of about 400 birds in seven subpopulations (six in the national park and one on Ile aux Aigrettes) in 2015 have resulted from Jones' leadership in the intervention, following similar methods to the Mauritius kestrel project.\nJones' work in Mauritius has always been in co-operation with the Government and he has had a close involvement with the development of their protected area network and the formation of their conservation department, the National Parks and Conservation Service. The Mauritian Wildlife Foundation and the National Parks and Conservation Service have grown in parallel and work jointly on several conservation initiatives including the running of Round Island and the species restoration projects.\nRestoration of island ecosystems.\nAs well as the many successes with bird species and helping establish Mauritius' first National Park, Jones has been instrumental in restoring the animal and plant communities on islands around Mauritius and Rodrigues that had been left denuded and barren by decades of exposure to invasive non-native mammals, such as goats, rabbits, hares, cats and rats. Recognising that the native, endemic reptiles \u2013 some of which having already become extinct \u2013 were important ecological components, as well as evolutionarily distinct animals, Jones, the late Gerald Durrell, and John Hartley (who managed overseas projects for the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust), initiated an effort to rebuild entire eco-systems, beginning with removing alien invasive species from Round Island\nWork to restore nine highly degraded Mascarene off-shore islands is underway (in Mauritius: Round Island, Ile aux Aigrettes, Flat Island, Ile aux Gabrielle, Gunner's Quoin, Ile de la Passe and Ile Fouquet; in Rodrigues: Ile Cocos and Ile aux Sables). This has involved a major programme of invasive species eradication and control in partnership with the Mauritian government, including the removal of 11 exotic vertebrates and invertebrates from multiple islands.\nThe jewel in the crown of this programme is Round Island, one of the world's most important and long-standing island restoration projects. For over 30 years, work to remove invasive mammals and plants has been carried out, combined with the re-establishment of native plant species, regeneration of stands of hardwood trees and the introduction of an ecological replacement keystone species to restore lost ecological functions.\nAssociation with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust.\nA follower, since childhood, of the work of Gerald Durrell, he first visited the Jersey Zoo in 1967. When he went to Mauritius in 1979 he worked closely with the Jersey Wildlife Preservation Trust (now Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust) and came into their employ in 1985, and continues to oversee the Trust's efforts in the Mascarenes. He is their Chief Scientist and a \"thought leader\" influencing many aspects of the Trust's work in both Jersey and elsewhere. He regularly lectures and teaches conservation theory, case studies and practical skills to students at Durrell Conservation Academy (formerly the International Training Centre), where his classes are prized for their humorous delivery and demonstrable field knowledge.\nJones has also taught students in Mauritius, Seychelles, St Lucia, Jersey, Galapagos, Guam, Fiji, Philippines and the United States.\nAwards and Indianapolis Prize nominations.\nIn 1985, Carl was presented with the Ridder of the Golden Ark, by Prince Bernard of the Netherlands, in recognition of conservation achievements on Mauritius. He was nominated by Sir Peter Scott. In 1998, Jones was the first ever recipient of the Carolina Medal given by the World Parrot Trust for \"outstanding achievement in parrot conservation\" for the work on the Echo Parakeet. In the New Year's Honours list of 2004, he was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire for the conservation of endangered species on Mauritius.\nJones has been nominated for the Indianapolis Prize, in 2012, 2014 and again in 2016. His co-nominees for this prize, which celebrates true heroes in the field of conservation, include Russell Mittermeier of Conservation International and Joel Berger of the Wildlife Conservation Society.

He spent part of his childhood in Liverpool, and was educated in England, at Charterhouse School and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he took a first class degree in the Classical Tripos in 1910. He then spent a year at the Sorbonne and graduated L. \u00e8s L.\nCareer.\nRoxburgh's first job was at Lancing College where he taught the young Evelyn Waugh. During the First World War he was turned down for service in the army, but in 1917 was finally accepted and joined the signal corps of the Royal Engineers. He saw action in 1918 and was mentioned in dispatches, while his younger brother Robert was killed at the Battle of Jutland.\nIn 1919 Roxburgh returned to Lancing as a housemaster. Early in 1923 he was appointed as the first headmaster of the emerging Stowe School, a project of E. H. Montauban, supported by the Martyrs' Memorial Trust. On 11 May 1923 the first boys arrived, and Roxburgh met each of them as he arrived. Stowe established high academic standards, with an especially strong reputation for music and art. Sports also flourished. Roxburgh was always a \"teaching head\" and made sure to teach every boy at some point in his time at the school, aiming to pass on his own enthusiasm for the best literature. He also believed that picturesque school grounds would ensure that every student would \"know beauty when he sees it all his life.\"\nRoxburgh's educational approach differed from most headmasters. Instead of corporal punishment, he addressed boys by their first names, let them ride bicycles, and encouraged their personal interests. David Niven, who was a student of his, wrote, \"How he did this, I shall never know, but he made every single boy at that school feel that what he said and what he did were of real importance to the headmaster.\"\nRoxburgh's goal was to develop students with good character and moral courage, young men that would be \"acceptable at a dance and invaluable in a shipwreck.\"\nThe Second World War was a terrible shock to Roxburgh. He had never married and saw the extended school as his family. One eighth of his old boys were decorated during the war, but one in seven was killed.\nHe finally retired from the school in 1949, after twenty-six years as its head master. The school's old boys' association, the Old Stoics, presented him with him a clock, a car, and a cheque, which he whimsically interpreted as \"a clock to tell him that his time was up, a motor-car to drive away, and journey-money enough to take him to the Antipodes.\" Appointing a Buckingham firm of auctioneers, he arranged a sale of numerous collectables surplus to his requirement on retirement. These included gifts he had accumulated over the years from grateful parents of boys at Stowe.\nRoxburgh died at his cottage in Great Brickhill on 6 May 1954, accidentally drowned after a fall into the bath.\nHis funeral took place at the school. His estate at death amounted to \u00a344,671, a substantial sum at the time (Approximately \u00a31,066,000 in 2017, when adjusted for inflation).\nNoel Annan's biography of Roxburgh, \"Roxburgh of Stowe,\" was the last work reviewed by Evelyn Waugh, one of his old boys from Lancing, in \"The Observer\" on 17 October 1965."}

The son of Greek immigrants, he was accepted by recruiters only after Greece joined the Allies in late 1940. Following spells with No. 65 Squadron and No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron, he joined No. 249 (Gold Coast) Squadron in Malta in March 1942. Flying Spitfire Mk Vs, Plagis was part of the multinational group of Allied pilots that successfully defended the strategically important island against numerically superior Axis forces over the next few months. Flying with No. 185 Squadron from early June, he was withdrawn to England in early July 1942.\nAfter a spell as an instructor in the UK, Plagis returned to action in September 1943 as commander of No. 64 Squadron, flying Spitfire Mk VCs over northern France. He took command of No. 126 (Persian Gulf) Squadron in June 1944, and led many attacks on German positions during the invasion of France and the campaign that followed; he was shot down over Arnhem during Operation Market Garden, but only lightly wounded. After converting to Mustang IIIs, he commanded a wing based at RAF Bentwaters that supported bombing missions. He finished the war with the rank of squadron leader and remained with the RAF afterwards, operating Gloster Meteors at the head of No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron.\nPlagis was the top-scoring Southern Rhodesian ace of the war, and the highest-scoring ace of Greek origin, with 16 confirmed aerial victories, including 11 over Malta. Awarded the Distinguished Service Order and other medals, he was also one of Rhodesia's most decorated veterans. The Southern Rhodesian capital, Salisbury, honoured his wartime contributions by naming a street in its northern Alexandra Park neighbourhood after him. On his return home after retiring from the RAF with the rank of wing commander in 1948, he set up home at 1\u00a0John Plagis Avenue, opened a bottle store bearing his name, and was a director of several companies, including Central African Airways in the 1960s. He contested the Salisbury City constituency in the 1962 general election, standing for the Rhodesian Front, but failed to win. He died in 1974.\nEarly life.\nJohn Plagis was born on 10 March 1919 in Gadzema, a mining village near Hartley, about south-west of the Southern Rhodesian capital Salisbury. His parents, Agorastos and Helen Plagis, were Greek immigrants from the island of Lemnos; he had five siblings. Christened with the Greek name Ioannis Agorastos, Plagis used the English form of Ioannis, John, from childhood, and attended Prince Edward School in Salisbury.\nHaving been interested in aviation since he was a boy, Plagis volunteered for the Southern Rhodesian Air Force (SRAF) soon after the outbreak of war in September 1939. He was turned down because he was the son of foreign nationals and therefore not a citizen, despite having lived in Rhodesia all his life. After Italy invaded Greece in late October 1940, bringing the Greeks into the war on the Allied side, Plagis applied again\u2014this time to join the Royal Air Force, which had absorbed the SRAF in April 1940\u2014and was accepted. Training first in Southern Rhodesia, then England, Plagis passed out with the rank of flight sergeant in June 1941 with above-average ratings in all of his flying assessments.\nThough he was officially in the RAF as a Greek (he became a Rhodesian citizen only after the war), Plagis considered himself a Rhodesian flyer and wore shoulder flashes on his uniform denoting him as such. He named each aircraft he piloted during the war after his sister Kay, and painted that name on the side of each cockpit. After briefly flying Spitfires with No. 65 Squadron RAF, Plagis joined No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron, an almost all-Rhodesian Spitfire unit, on 19 July 1941. He served in the UK for about half a year, during which he was commissioned as a pilot officer, before being posted to the Mediterranean theatre in January 1942.\nAir war in Europe and the Mediterranean.\nFirst tour of operations.\nPlagis's first major operation was Operation Spotter, the first of many British endeavours to reinforce the besieged island of Malta in the face of German and Italian assaults during the Battle of the Mediterranean. Malta was considered to be of vital strategic importance, and its defence was looking increasingly precarious in March 1942. \"Spotter\" was a plan to strengthen its British garrison with 16 new Spitfire Mk Vs, which would be carried part of the way from Gibraltar on the aircraft carrier HMS \"Eagle\", then flown to Malta; the pilots would then become part of the severely depleted No. 249 (Gold Coast) Squadron. The team of pilots comprised eight British airmen, four Australians, two New Zealanders and two Southern Rhodesians\u2014Plagis and his close friend Pilot Officer Doug Leggo.\nThe operation, carried out on 7 March 1942, was largely successful and 15 of the 16 Spitfires reached Malta. Plagis and Leggo arrived to find a third Rhodesian, Flight Officer George \"Buck\" Buchanan, already attached to the squadron. A further delivery of 16 Spitfires, Operation Picket I, was attempted on 21 March, but this was less successful; only nine of the planes arrived. Thirteen Spitfire reinforcement operations were ultimately launched between March and October 1942, playing a key role in the siege. The \"Luftwaffe\" and the Italian \"Regia Aeronautica\" meanwhile attempted to bomb Malta into submission, turning the airfields into \"a wilderness of craters, the docks\u00a0... a shambles, Valletta a mass of broken limestone\u00a0...\"\nThe \"Luftwaffe\" launched a major attack against key Maltese airfields at dawn on 20 March. Leggo, who had not slept for over 24\u00a0hours, returned to the airfield in the early hours having spent the night with a girlfriend. As the German planes approached he was ordered to prepare to fly. Plagis attempted to stop his friend from going, but Leggo insisted on flying, and took off at 08:05 as part of a group of four Spitfires and 12 Hurricanes aiming to intercept a squadron of Messerschmitt Bf 109s. He was soon seen to be flying poorly. A German pilot noticed this and attacked Leggo from close range, seriously damaging his aircraft and forcing him to bail out. Another Bf 109 then swooped and either fired at Leggo or collapsed his parachute with its slipstream, causing him to fall to his death. When Plagis learned what had happened, he was inconsolable, holding himself responsible. In his journal, he vowed to \"shoot down ten for Doug\u2014I will too, if it takes me a lifetime\".\nPlagis shot down his first enemy aircraft on 25 March 1942, and on 1 April achieved four more aerial victories in a single afternoon, thereby becoming the siege of Malta's first Spitfire ace. His downing of four enemies in a few hours won him much praise from superiors and reporters, and contributed to his growing reputation as an aggressive but skilful combat pilot. He was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) on 1 May 1942, the citation noting that he had \"destroyed 4 and probably destroyed a further 3 hostile aircraft\". \"With complete indifference to odds against him, he presses home his attacks with skill and courage,\" it continued\u2014\"He has set an outstanding example.\"\nOn 11 May, Plagis attempted to down an Italian Reggiane Re.2001 by flying straight at it to ram it; taking erratic evasive manoeuvres, the Italian aircraft stalled and almost crashed into the sea. Thinking he had downed the enemy, Plagis claimed afterwards to have achieved an aerial victory without firing a shot, but the Italian flight reported no losses. Plagis's Spitfire was lightly hit during this engagement, and the Rhodesian had some luck returning safely; he landed with only three gallons (14 litres) of fuel left. On 16 May, Plagis and an English ace, Pilot Officer Peter Nash, destroyed a Bf 109 for a shared kill that became No. 249 Squadron's 100th victory over Malta. Amid the continuing siege, the need for a major supply convoy to Malta was becoming urgent; the Governor Lord Gort warned Britain in early June that if no supplies came by August, he would have to surrender to prevent a famine.\nPlagis was promoted in the field to flight lieutenant on 4 June 1942 and transferred to No. 185 Squadron to command \"B\" Flight. He shot down two Re.2001s two days later to bring his tally of victories to ten (thereby fulfilling his pledge following Leggo's death), and destroyed a Bf 109 on 7 June. A month later, he received a Bar to his DFC, having been adjudged to have shown \"exceptional skill and gallantry in combat\u00a0... Undeterred by superior numbers of attacking aircraft, he presses home his attacks with great determination.\" Plagis left Malta when his tour expired on 7 July 1942, flying first to Gibraltar, then the UK. The British finally delivered vital supplies to Malta on 15 August with Operation Pedestal (known in Malta as the \"Santa Marija Convoy\").\nOn arriving in England, Plagis was found to be suffering from malnutrition, scabies and physical and mental fatigue. He briefly convalesced in a nursing home, then spent a year as an instructor in England. He was promoted to probationary flying officer on 1 October 1942.\nSecond tour of operations.\nPlagis returned to action in September 1943, when he was appointed commanding officer of No. 64 Squadron, then flying Spitfire Mk VCs over northern France from RAF Coltishall in Norfolk. Plagis downed a Bf 109 over France on 24 September 1943, then a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 on 23 November, and formally received the rank of flight lieutenant on 8 December 1943.\nAt the start of June 1944, Plagis assumed command of No. 126 (Persian Gulf) Squadron, flying Spitfire Mk IXs that had recently been moved from Malta to assist in the invasion of Normandy. Six of the squadron's planes had been purchased by the Persian Gulf Spitfire Fund, and duly named after the donating sheikdoms; Plagis's aircraft, which he chose because of the large letter \"K\" on its tail (echoing his sister's name), had \"Muscat\" painted in English and Arabic script on its side. He added to this a full rendering of \"Kay\" and other personal decorations.\nAfter leading No. 126 Squadron on raids into Normandy during the Allied invasion, Plagis took part in many of the attacks on German positions in northern France and the Low Countries that followed over the next few months. He was shot down over Arnhem in the Netherlands during Operation Market Garden in September 1944, but suffered only minor injuries and quickly returned to action. He received the Distinguished Service Order on 3 November for his \"participat[ion] in very many sorties during which much damage has been inflicted on\u00a0... [German] shipping, radio stations, oil storage tanks, power plants and other installations\". The citation particularly stressed an engagement in which a small group of Allied fighters led by Plagis had taken on a far superior force of enemy aircraft and shot down five of them, Plagis himself downing two. Plagis was described as \"a brave and resourceful leader whose example has proved a rare source of inspiration\".\nPlagis converted to Mustang IIIs along with the rest of his squadron at RAF Bentwaters in Suffolk during December 1944 and January 1945, and spent the rest of the war flying bomber escort missions at the head of Bentwaters Wing, which included No. 126 Squadron. He was promoted to squadron leader on 28 March 1945. Germany surrendered on 7 May, ending the war in Europe.\nPlagis finished the war with a tally of 16 enemy aircraft confirmed destroyed (including two shared victories counted as half a kill each), two shared probably destroyed, six damaged and one shared damaged. This made him Southern Rhodesia's highest-scoring ace of the war, as well as the top-scoring ace of Greek origin. He was one of the most-decorated Southern Rhodesian servicemen of the war.\nPost-war service and later life.\nPlagis stayed with the RAF following the end of hostilities, and from September 1946 to December 1947 commanded No. 266 (Rhodesia) Squadron in England and Germany, flying Gloster Meteor F.3s. He was awarded the Airman's Cross by the government of the Netherlands in October 1946. After retiring from the military with the rank of wing commander, Plagis returned home to Southern Rhodesia in 1948. A street in the north Salisbury suburb of Alexandra Park had been named after him in recognition of his wartime exploits; he moved into the house at the end of the road, 1\u00a0John Plagis Avenue. He married in 1954 and had three sons and a daughter.\nPlagis set up and ran a bottle store bearing his name in Salisbury, and was involved in several businesses during the next three decades, serving as a director on company boards, including Central African Airways from 1963 to 1968. He joined the Rhodesian Front on its formation in 1962, and was its candidate in Salisbury City in that year's general election, losing to the United Federal Party's John Roger Nicholson by 631 votes to 501. According to a report published by the Zimbabwe African National Union in 1969, Plagis was by then working in the office of the Rhodesian Prime Minister Ian Smith (himself a Second World War Spitfire pilot), with responsibility for the premier's written correspondence.\nIn later life, Plagis became a friend of British ace Douglas Bader, a prominent supporter of Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965. Bader, Smith and Plagis often socialised. Plagis also knew L\u00a0Ron Hubbard, the American founder of Scientology, who briefly relocated to Salisbury in 1966. Hubbard initiated numerous business schemes in Rhodesia, including the purchase of the Bumi Hills Hotel at Kariba. Plagis was one of two local businessmen who partnered with Hubbard in the Bumi Hills deal. He also sold Hubbard an interest in his holdings before the American was deported.\nPlagis died in 1974, aged 54 or 55; according to Lauren St John, an author from Gadzema, he had taken his own life, having never truly readjusted to the civilian world."}

From 1912 to 1937 he was editor of \"The Chinese Recorder and Missionary Journal\", published in Shanghai, the leading English language journal of the Protestant missionary community. \nEarly life and the \"Call to China\".\nFrank and his younger brother came to the United States in 1889 as steerage passengers and settled in Baltimore. Frank joined a Southern Baptist church, where he met Carrie Mae Dietz. He graduated summa cum laude from Bucknell University, in Pennsylvania in 1899, and quickly married Carrie Mae. In 1903 he graduated from Rochester Theological Seminary, was ordained, and became an American citizen. In 1894, when the Student Volunteer Movement (SVM) organized campaigns, he had stood up at a meeting organized by a missionary from China and said \"Here I am Lord! Send me!\" In 1900 when John R. Mott of the SVM spoke, he heard \"The Call\" again, and successfully applied to be appointed as a missionary for the Southern Baptist Convention. He, his wife, and his son arrived in Shanghai on October 16, 1902 and began work with the Central China Mission. In June 1911, Rawlinson was appointed Assistant Editor on the editorial board of \"The Chinese Recorder\", and in 1914, joined the executive committee of the China Continuation Committee, which was formed to carry out in China the work of the 1910 World Missionary Conference. In 1913 he became editor-in-chief of the \"Recorder\", a post which he retained until his death. \nIn 1916, the family returned to American on the Japanese steamer \"Shinyo Maru\" for furlough. Shortly after Christmas, Carrie Mae slipped on the ice, fractured her hip, and on January 7, 1917, died from a blood infection. Frank's grief was compounded when the family Baptist church refused to allow a non-Baptist friend deliver the eulogy. On the steamer from Shanghai, the family had struck up a friendship with Florence Lang, who was herself returning from Bombay, where she worked as General Secretary of the YWCA. Florence and Frank renewed their friendship, and Frank soon wrote her that he thanked God for his \"resurrection.\" Although the Southern Baptist Board had reservations as to whether she was capable of representing Baptist values in China, they were married July 29, 1917. Their son, John Lang Rawlinson, was born in 1920. \nDuring the furlough year, Frank earned an M.A. from Teachers College, Columbia University, where he took courses on schools and religious education. Bucknell awarded him an honorary D.D. Upon his return to China in 1918, he resumed a busy schedule. He lectured at the Nanking University School for Missionaries, and after 1921 was a lecturer at the North China Union Language School in Beijing. Lecturing to new missionaries on how to adapt to Chinese culture led Rawlinson to read the Chinese classics. In addition to Confucius and Mozi he read modern Chinese scholars such as Liang Qichao and Hu Shih. Physically and spiritually happy in his new marriage, he began to develop a more favorable understanding of Chinese religions, especially Buddhism. Although he was often away from home, Frank and Florence conducted extensive discussions on family, their relationship, and theology by letters. In one letter he compared her to \"the smile of God,\" but explained that he found his faith moving away from its evangelical foundations. He described his Call as \"a vision of human need that has never left me..., (but) it is true that I have changed my ideas on how to meet it.\" \nSocial Gospel, nationalism, and revolution.\nAfter World War I, the New Culture Movement advocated a scientific approach to politics and religion, and began to oppose foreign influence in China. At the same time, an influential group of Protestant missionaries in China worked to build what the historian Daniel Bays calls a \"Sino-foreign Protestant Establishment\" which saw Chinese nationalism and Chinese Christianity as working together to build a modern and independent nation. Rawlinson was a leader in this group. \nAs Rawlinson read more widely in Chinese classics and Buddhist texts, which he now could read in Chinese, he began attacking the dogmatism of the mission community and the public at home. Chinese ideas of God, he told his students, might possibly compare favorably with early Hebrew ideas. Christians should not denounce Buddhist conceptions of love, compassion, and self-sacrifice but realize their strength. President John Leighton Stuart of Yenching University offered Rawlinson a position teaching Christian apologetics in 1920, but it fell through because his Southern Baptist mission board declined to fund it. Rawlinson was a founding member of the Yenching Life Fellowship Movement sponsored by Christian faculty members. \"Chinese Recorder\" published a number of articles from this group who were working for dialogue between Chinese intellectuals and Christians and for a Chinese Christian Church which would be \u0093\"of the Chinese, for the Chinese and by the Chinese.\u0094\"\n\"The Chinese Recorder\" under Rawlinson's editorship became a forum for debate on theological questions and the political claims of Chinese nationalism. The journal sought out articles by and about Chinese intellectuals and commissioned translations to present important thinking on politics and religion. For instance, the May 1920 issue of the journal included \"Christianity and the Chinese People,\" by Chen Duxiu, who would be the co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party. Pearl S. Buck, for instance, in 1927, well before she became famous, published an article \"Is There A Place for the Foreign Missionary?\" Later, her resignation under pressure from the Presbyterian Board in 1932 troubled him.\nThese liberal views antagonized the Southern Baptist Mission Board, at that time in the beginning of the controversy between modernist and fundamentalist conceptions of theology and the role of missions. The Board objected to the fact that Rawlinson edited an interdenominational journal, not a Baptist one. In 1921 the Board dismissed him. Rawlinson acknowledged to Florence that this was a \"hard kick,\" but reported that he had \"not yet been kicked very far.\" The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, which supported interdenominational work, accepted Rawlinson in 1922. Rawlinson was one of the prime organizers of the National Christian Conference held in Shanghai in May 1922. The Conference surveyed the state of Christianity in China, pushed for Chinese control of Christian institutions, and set up the National Christian Council of China to carry out this program. He supported Chinese Christian leaders such as Cheng Jingyi, who led the Council. Cheng and other leaders aimed to develop a Chinese Christianity which was not based on independent denominations but on a unified church. Rawlinson edited the Council's Chinese Christian Yearbook from 1922. Confucian teachings continued to attract him, and he confessed in a letter to Florence that \"I am something of a pagan.\" \nFrom 1924 to 1925 Rawlinson studied and lectured as a McFadden Mission Fellow at Union Theological Seminary in New York. On his return to China he found that Chinese politics had become even more nationalistic and anti-Christian. Kenneth Scott Latourette, the leading scholar of missions at the time, reflected a feeling shared among liberal missionaries such as Rawlinson that the Church had \"become a partner in Western imperialism and could not well disavow some responsibility for the consequences.\" \nIn 1926, Rawlinson published \"Chinese Ideas of the Supreme Being\" and in 1927 his most important work, \"Naturalization of Christianity in China\". The motivation behind both was to meet the arguments of the hot Chinese nationalists and anti-Christians who attacked the church as irredeemably imperialist and irrational and to convince his fellow mission Christians to cede authority not only over the institutional church, a process which was already well under way, but to also cede the authority to define who was a Christian and what was Christian doctrine. The book drew from his years of talking to Chinese intellectuals and lecturing to newly arrived missionaries. He prepared the arguments for the book in a series of editorials. He first argued that being a Christian was not a matter of church membership -- \"a Christian is one who loves Christ. Nothing more, nothing less.\" Next, he challenged critics who claimed that China lacked the capacity to organize, citing in rebuttal the record of imperial China in organizing and administering its large territory. Nor did he accept the argument that Chinese cared little for morality or the individual, since the philosophies of Daoism and Buddhism did so, and Chinese family values were exemplary. He pointed out that the ancient Chinese had stated the Golden Rule long before Jesus. In short, a Chinese Christianity was possible but the main obstacle was Western refusal to accept Chinese as equals and recognize the strength of Chinese culture, The burden was on the Christian church to itself become Chinese:\nIn the end, Rawlinson concluded that a Christianity naturalized to China would leave denominations and sectarianism behind and not even cling to Christian ideas of salvation.\nRawlinson argued that Christianity could not succeed in China if it was identified with either imperialist domination or capitalist exploitation. In particular, he pointed out that it was \"somewhat humiliating\" to force China to grant permission for \"Christian aliens\" to build churches and propagate their religion under protection of extraterritoriality. He welcomed Chinese colleagues into the leadership of Christian institutions and supported the anti-imperialist program of the Chinese Nationalist Party. The spread of Marxism raised serious questions, however. Rawlinson approved the egalitarian social aims which Chinese communists announced while condemning their violent methods. In 1934, the \"Chinese Recorder\" ran a series of articles on \"The Challenge of Communism,\" the title of a missionary conference. Rawlinson conceded that if it sought a \"juster and more equitable social order,\" communism was supportable. In that year, Chiang Kai-shek launched his New Life Movement as an answer to communism's social appeal. Rawlinson applauded, but looked to the Rural Reconstruction Movement for a Christian approach to the problems of China's rural majority. Rawlinson's June 1934 editorial, \"Beyond Communism,\" reminded readers that as doctrine Christianity was \"adverse\" to capitalism but in fact had accommodated to it easily enough. Now Christianity found that communism had \"stolen its thunder,\" for Christianity had never set out to \"change the entire lot of the underprivileged as communism has.\" Christianity was preferable to communism but had to prove itself in action.\nThe outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War posed a challenge to the Christian missionary. In what turned out to be Rawlinson's last letter to his children on August 3, 1937, he told them \"I do not like war. I feel that it is unChristian,\" yet \"I don't know what else China can do but resist Japan unless she wants to become practically a Japanese colony.\" .\nOn August 14, 1937 a Chinese fighter plane, damaged by anti-aircraft fire from a Japanese battleship in the river, accidentally dropped a bomb onto a crowded Shanghai street, killing over 1,500 people. Rawlinson was among them. The \"New York Times\" reported his death on the front page. \" Life Magazine ran a group of pictures of Rawlinson and his wife and called him \"one of the most influential white men in China,\" commenting that Rawlinson \"felt China could take Christianity without ceasing to be Chinese.\""}

Her domestic realism became popular with women, as did her conduct books for girls.\nLife.\nHenrietta Keddie was born at Cupar, Fife, on 4 March 1827 to Philip Keddie (1793/4\u20131852), a lawyer, and his wife, Mary, n\u00e9e Gibb (d. 1869). She spent her childhood summers at Grange Farm, outside Elie and Earlsferry, where her father owned a coalmine. She was educated by an older sister, Margaret, and then attended school in Leith for a time.\nThe family broke up in the 1840s, although \"Grange collieries\" continued to some extent up to the early 1860s. In 1848, Henrietta and three of her sisters set up a school in Cupar. In 1869, after the death of her parents and most of her siblings, she and Margaret moved to Blackheath, London and then to Kensington. Left alone after Margaret's death in 1880, Henrietta went on a continental tour with friends and an adopted daughter in 1884, and then moved to Oxford for twenty years and Bristol for two, before returning to London, where she died in Belsize Park Gardens on 6 January 1914.\nWritings.\nKeddie began writing in the 1850s. Her first two novels failed to sell, however. Her first paid story was \"Meg of Elibank\", based on a local Selkirk tradition, which appeared in \"Fraser's Magazine\" in 1856. Some of her earliest publications appeared in \"Blackwood's Magazine\", others in \"Cornhill Magazine\", \"Good Words\" and the \"Sunday Magazine\". These efforts introduced her to writers and intellectuals such as Dr John Brown, Isabella Bird and Margaret Oliphant. Her circle grew in London to include the historian J. A. Froude, Dinah Craik, Mrs Henry Wood, Jean Ingelow and others.\nAs a prolific writer of novels under the name Sarah Tytler, Keddie was an exponent of domestic realism, which was notably popular among female readers. Her first novel, \"The Kinnears. A Scottish Story\" (1852) went unnoticed, but she began to build up a following, particularly after her move to London. Many of her novels had an 18th-century background, including \"Citoyenne Jacqueline\" (1865) set in the French Revolution. In relation to her novel \"Beauty and the Beast\" (1884), about a private soldier who inherits a baronetcy, the literary biographer Rosemary Mitchell writes, \"Although the plot is sensational, her talent for original and sympathetic characterization is considerable and her perception of the problems of social divisions keen and realistic.\" \"Saint Mungo's City\" (1884, about Glasgow) was unusual in focusing on urban, rather than rural Scotland. Perhaps her most famous book was \"Logie Town\" (1887), set in her home village of Cupar.\nKeddie's work for children and young people was also popular. \"Papers for Thoughtful Girls\" (1862; the 1866 edition had illustrations by the Pre-Raphaelite painter John Everett Millais) and \"Sweet Counsel. A Book for Girls\" (1866) covered subjects such as intellect, friendship, self-sacrifice and fashion, revealing \"moderately progressive views on women's roles\". She also did educational work, such as \"Musical Composers and their Works\" (1875) and \"The Old Masters and their Pictures for the Use of Schools and Learners in Art\" (1880), and biographical compendia such as \"Six Royal Ladies of the House of Hanover\" (1898). Another book of hers was \"Jane Austen and Her Works\" (1880), although a later Jane Austen biographer complained that she simply \"filled her book with r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of the novels.\" Her final work was \"Three Generations: The Story of a Middle-Class Scottish Family\" (1911).\n\"The Spectator\", reviewing the novel \"The Blackhall Ghosts\" on 12 January 1889, had mixed feelings about the characterization: \"The writer has made a fine character of Joanna Endicott. Queer she seemed to those who failed to see through her disguise, and she is almost an enigma to us... However, she is a dignified woman, with deep feelings and a wonderful self-control, and her strange behaviour springs from one overpowering sentiment, the love of home and family. In her the writer has evidently embodied what she believes to be the ideal of a self-reliant, self-controlled woman, animated by a deep-rooted passion. As for her sister Celia, we must frankly say we do not understand her; she is a most extraordinary young lady, and is obviously overdrawn. A more nasty, cruel, and unnatural creature we have never met with in fiction... Lucy's silliness is probably exaggerated, though she is by far the most natural... All these portraits require more shading; they are too deeply lined, we might almost say, dug in.\"\nBibliography.\nThere is a partial list of Keddie's works on the Tour Scotland site (see References). However, the entry has several misprints. There are around 140 entries for Sarah Tytler in the British Library Main Catalogue."}

Their exploits are known in part through the fictional film \"Cattle Annie and Little Britches\" (1981), directed by Lamont Johnson and starring Amanda Plummer in her film debut as Cattle Annie, with Diane Lane as Little Britches.\nCattle Annie and Little Britches were crack shots with both pistol and rifle, but today they are mostly unknown outside of the film. Yet they were once among the most recognized names among outlaws in the Oklahoma and Indian territories, where they carried out their short-lived criminal ventures.\nEmbracing the criminal element.\nAnna was born in Lawrence in Douglas County in eastern Kansas, one of eight children of James C. and Rebekah McDoulet. When Anna was four years old, the family moved to Coyville in Wilson County, in southeastern Kansas. Anna worked as a hotel dishwasher and performed other odd jobs. When she was twelve, the family moved to the Osage Reservation near Skiatook north of Tulsa in the northern Oklahoma Territory, where she turned outlaw. Annie and Little Britches followed tales of the Bill Doolin gang from reading dime novelists like Ned Buntline, who became famous for his mostly fictional account of Buffalo Bill Cody as a western frontier hero and showman.\nFor two years, Cattle Annie and Little Britches roamed the former Indian Territory, often working together and at other times alone. They stole horses, sold alcohol to the Osage and Pawnee Indians, and warned outlaw gangs whenever law-enforcement officers were nearby. They wore men's clothing and packed pistols on their hips. Their adventures netted headlines from Guthrie, the capital of the former Oklahoma Territory, to Coffeyville in southeastern Kansas, where the Dalton gang attempted to rob two banks simultaneously on October 5, 1892.\nU.S. Marshal Steve Burke captured 13-year-old Cattle Annie climbing from a window in 1895. (Marshal Bill Tilghman had a more difficult task apprehending Little Britches, who engaged in a physical confrontation with the famous lawman before he took her into custody.) Annie was sentenced to one year in the Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Framingham. Because of health issues, she was soon paroled. She remained in Framingham for some time, having informed corrections officers that, if she returned to Oklahoma, she would likely have fallen back into her criminal ways. In 1898, she was working as a housekeeper for Mrs. Mary Daniels in Sherborn in Middlesex County south of Framingham. A few months later, she may have moved to New York City, where she may have died of tuberculosis.\nAnother scenario.\nAnother legitimate report claims that Annie left Framingham to return to Oklahoma where she wed Earl Frost of Perry on March 13, 1901. The couple had two sons, Robert C. Frost (1903\u20131993) of Oklahoma City and Carlos D. Frost, later of Malibu, California. The Frosts divorced in Noble County, Oklahoma in October 1909, probably because Annie had joined a Wild West show. The historical museum in Guthrie maintains that, soon after the divorce from Frost, Annie married Whitmore R. Roach (1879-1947), a Texas native, veteran of World War I, and painting contractor in Oklahoma City, where they lived after 1912. They had resided from 1910 to 1912 in Fort Worth, Texas. This \"Emma McDoulet Roach\" is interred at Rose Hill Burial Park in Oklahoma City. She died in 1978, just short of her 96th birthday. Her newspaper obituary makes no mention of her early days or even the first name \"Anna\" but instead refers to \"Emma\", the shortened form of \"Emmaline\". The obituary indicates that she had been a bookkeeper in her later working career. Her services were held in her home church, Olivet Baptist in Oklahoma City.\nMeanwhile, Little Britches also served a short sentence at the reformatory in Framingham, but her whereabouts thereafter are unknown. Some reports indicate that Little Britches returned to Tulsa, where she was married, had a family, and led an exemplary life.\nIn popular culture.\nFilm.\nJohnson's film, \"Cattle Annie and Little Britches\" (1981), features Burt Lancaster as an historically inaccurate and much older Bill Doolin, Amanda Plummer as Cattle Annie, Rod Steiger as Marshal William Tilghman, Scott Glenn as Bill Dalton, and Buck Taylor, particularly known to audiences as the blacksmith-turned-deputy Newly O'Brien on CBS's \"Gunsmoke\", as the outlaw Dynamite Dick, presumably Dan Clifton, called \"Dynamite Dan.\"\nPrint.\nNovelist Robert Ward, a native of Baltimore, Maryland, penned \"Cattle Annie and Little Britches\" (1977), his personal interpretation of the romantic legends of the Doolin-Dalton gang."}

{"name": "William L. Spicer", "type": "person", "abstract": "William Leach Spicer (October 10, 1918 \u2013 September 23, 1991) was a businessman from Fort Smith, Arkansas, who from 1962 to 1964 was the embattled state chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party.", "wikipage": "William Leach Spicer (October 10, 1918 \u2013 September 23, 1991) was a businessman from Fort Smith, Arkansas, who from 1962 to 1964 was the embattled state chairman of the Arkansas Republican Party.\nOriginally supported for the position by Winthrop Rockefeller of Morrilton, Spicer soon broke with Rockefeller, the party's key financial backer, over matters of policy issues and party function. Spicer declined to seek reelection as the chairman, but he had resisted intraparty calls that he resign before his term ended in August 1964. He suggested that he could support a \"Republicans for Faubus\" organization against Rockefeller's gubernatorial bid in 1964, but he remained committed to Republican presidential nominee Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, whom Rockefeller supported once Goldwater was nominated.\nBackground.\nA native of Yell County in western Arkansas, Spicer was the only child of William Jacob Spicer (1893\u20131979), a Methodist minister for sixty-four years, and the former Ora Leach (1896\u20131989), hence his middle name. The couple married in 1917 in Logan County, Arkansas. William J. and Ora Spicer are interred at Oak Hill Memorial Cemetery in Booneville in Logan County. Spicer's paternal grandparents were Monroe Moses Spicer (1876\u20131926) and the former Delia C. Cummings (1873\u20131957); they are interred at Stony Point Cemetery, also in Logan County.\nIn the 1930 census, Spicer was living with his parents in Woodruff County in eastern Arkansas. In the 1940 census, Spicer, then twenty-one, was listed as residing still with his parents in Wynne in Cross County, also in eastern Arkansas, where his father, then forty-six, was a pastor. In 1946, Spicer married the former Freda Cowell in Sydney in New South Wales, Australia, possibly while having been on military duty during World War II. The couple had three children, David, Michael, and Sarah Spicer. Mrs. Spicer died in Australia in 1983.\nThe owner of a chain of drive-in theaters, Spicer in 1956 challenged the incumbent Democrat James William Trimble of Berryville for Arkansas' 3rd congressional district seat and received 34,318 votes (38.7 percent) to Trimble's 54,281 (61.3 percent). Spicer carried Newton and Searcy counties but lost his own Sebastian County, where he polled 46.7 percent of the ballots. Spicer finished six percentage points behind the 1952 Republican congressional candidate, John H. \"Jack\" Joyce, an attorney from Fayetteville and a fighter pilot in World War II who in that campaign opposed the continuation of the Korean War.,\nSpicer's fellow Republican, Ben C. Henley, a lawyer from Harrison in Boone County, also in northwestern Arkansas, ran that year against U.S. Senator J. William Fulbright but finished with only 17 percent of the vote.\nSpicer as chairman.\nWhen Ben Henley, stepped down in 1962 as the state Republican chairman, Rockefeller publicly endorsed Spicer for the position. At the time Spicer faced opposition in the central committee from Henry M. Britt of Hot Springs, the party's 1960 gubernatorial nominee against Orval Faubus and an attorney and later a judge of the 18th Judicial Circuit Court. Upon his election as chairman in a bid for party unity, Spicer named Britt as the Republican general counsel. Though in the 1950s, Spicer and Britt had supported Dwight D. Eisenhower, by 1963 they were early backers of Goldwater. Spicer called himself a \"conservative Republican. I am opposed to socialism and these liberal pinkos in every form and fashion.\"\nSpicer and Britt expected to control federal patronage through the state party committee and were unwilling to cede authority to Rockefeller, who had been since 1961 the state's Republican national committeeman. Within months of his becoming chairman, Spicer was engaged in bitter political attacks on Winthrop Rockefeller. The cause of the disagreement between and the Spicer-Britt forces was related to both patronage and differences in partisan philosophy. Spicer had wanted Rockefeller's party-building activities coordinated through what he called the \"state organization.\"\nSpicer particularly quarreled with Rockefeller's paid assistant Everett Ham. According to John L. Ward, a Rockefeller biographer, Ham \"could be \u2013 and frequently was \u2013 quite heavy-handed, excusing it in the name of building a two-party system. Ham knew how to roll heads, and he did it. You could go with Rockefeller, or get out of the way. The old mossback Republicans did neither.\" There was hence constant feuding in 1963\u20131964. Ham derided the intra-party rivals as \"Post Office Republicans\" who concentrated on local patronage over the rigors of running political campaigns in a traditional one-party state. As the tensions with Ham escalated, Spicer wrote Rockefeller to request that Ham be placed in another position in Rockefeller's organization, one in which Ham could not clash with Spicer. William Spicer also feuded with Marion Burton, an attorney from North Little Rock hired by Rockefeller to act as Spicer's own, unwanted executive assistant.\nIn 1963, Spicer contacted George Hinman, the Republican national committeeman from New York State, an ally of Nelson A. Rockefeller, the New York governor and brother of Winthrop Rockefeller, who challenged Goldwater for the presidential nomination, to discuss the intraparty friction underway in Arkansas. Spicer told Hinman that he found it interesting to observe \"the activities of some of the boys operating in Arkansas. I have never seen so many moves being made by the wrong people in the wrong manner at the wrong time.\" Spicer also contacted Ab Herman, the national GOP director of political organization, to complain that the Republican National Committee was showing favoritism to Winthrop Rockefeller: \"It is most unfortunate to experience this disunity and turmoil in the Republican Party in Arkansas. Every effort has been made to work as a team.\"\nOn January 13, 1964, Spicer wrote to John Paul Hammerschmidt, a businessman from Harrison, and Eugene \"Gene\" Holman of DeQueen to explain that he was aware of efforts underway to remove him from the chairmanship. It was Hammerschmidt who succeeded Spicer in the fall of 1964 when Spicer resigned, having vowed \"to wash my hands of the whole thing.\"\nIn 1963, the Arkansas Republican executive committee criticized Rockefeller's retaining of his own staff men to conduct a political drive. In March 1964, however, the same committee reversed itself and approved Rockefeller's hiring of four men at his own expense to enlist party members. A Little Rock businessman explained that the GOP under Henley and Spicer had been \"sort of a small, closely held corporation here, and the members of the clan didn't want it to get too big.\" Spicer partisans said that the Rockefeller associates had \"kicked the old Republicans out ... imagine the reaction of a 50-or 60-year old Republican who's been spending his own time and money working at this to have some two-bit employee come in and tell him what to do to win an election.\"\nWinthrop Rockefeller said that he had letters from new arrivals in Arkansas who had insisted that Spicer had made them fell \"not welcome\" in the GOP.G. Thomas Eisele, a veteran Rockefeller advisor and a U.S. District Judge in Little Rock, admitted that Ham had employed \"ruthless tactics\" against party conservatives. Rockefeller stressed the two-party theme, established a United Republican Fund that was raising nearly $8,000 per month by 1966, and worked to establish a permanent Republican committee in each of the seventy-five counties. In 1972, not long before his death, Rockefeller reflected on his fight with the Spicer partisans:\nThe basic problem was political philosophy coupled with enormous ego. His following was politically antagonistic to my basic philosophy. They were the right-wingers up to and including sometimes Birchers, and they were power-crazy.\nPresidential politics, 1964.\nSpicer accused Winthrop Rockefeller of dividing the small party organization by politicking behind the scenes for Nelson Rockefeller's presidential primary campaign against Goldwater. Though Spicer preferred Goldwater, he suggested that to maintain unity the party send unpledged delegates to the national convention which met that year in San Francisco, California. \"It is inappropriate for the national committeeman or the state chairman to be campaigning for any candidate,\" Spicer said. Spicer admitted that Winthrop Rockefeller \"sees the policies of the Republican Party in one direction, and I see them 180 degrees in the other direction.\"\nCoupled with Rockefeller's disputes with Spicer and Britt, the presidential divisions within the Arkansas GOP undermined Winthrop Rockefeller's own plans to run for governor in 1964, when he lost to the Democratic incumbent Orval Faubus, who ironically in 1955 had appointed Rockefeller to the highly visible chairmanship of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission.\nEisele and Ham disagreed on how to promote Rockefeller in the 1964 gubernatorial race against Faubus. Eisele urged the formation of a moderate coalition that would appeal to supporters of U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson, who was supporting Faubus. Ham urged the party in Arkansas to embrace Goldwater to increase conservative support for Rockefeller, who was expected also to receive some moderate and liberal support among Independent voters. Ultimately both Johnson and Faubus won the state with 57 percent of the vote.\nAfter two years as chairman, Spicer was succeeded in 1964 by Rockefeller's subsequent choice, John Paul Hammerschmidt, a World War II Medal of Honor winner. On November 8, 1966, in a sudden upsurge for the Arkansas GOP that attracted national attention, Rockefeller, after having lost to Orval Faubus two years earlier, was elected governor, and Hammerschmidt became the first member of the GOP to represent the state in the United States House of Representatives since Reconstruction. Hammerschmidt prevailed in his race in the 3rd congressional district, the same seat that Spicer had sought a decade earlier."}

{"name": "Tron (hacker)", "type": "person", "abstract": "Boris Floricic (Flori\u010di\u0107), better known by his pseudonym Tron (8 June 1972 \u2013 17 October 1998), was a German-Croat hacker and phreaker whose death in unclear circumstances has led to various conspiracy theories.", "wikipage": "Boris Floricic (Flori\u010di\u0107), better known by his pseudonym Tron (8 June 1972 \u2013 17 October 1998), was a German-Croat hacker and phreaker whose death in unclear circumstances has led to various conspiracy theories. He is also known for his Diplom thesis presenting one of the first public implementations of a telephone with built-in voice encryption, the \"Cryptophon\".\nFloricic's pseudonym was a reference to the eponymous character in the 1982 Disney film \"Tron\". Floricic was interested in defeating computer security mechanisms; amongst other hacks, he broke the security of the German phonecard and produced working clones. He was subsequently sentenced to 15 months in jail for the physical theft of a public phone (for reverse engineering purposes) but the sentence was suspended to probation.\nFrom December 2005 to January 2006, media attention was drawn to Floricic when his parents and Andy M\u00fcller-Maguhn brought legal action in Germany against the Wikimedia Foundation and its German chapter Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. The first preliminary injunction tried to stop Wikipedia from publishing Floricic's full name, and a second one followed, temporarily preventing the use of the German Internet domain as a redirect address to the German Wikipedia.\nEarly life.\nFloricic grew up in Gropiusstadt, a suburb in southern Berlin (West Berlin at the time). His interests in school focused on technical subjects. He left school after ten years and completed a three-year Vocational education (\"Berufsausbildung\") offered by the Technical University of Berlin and graduated as a specialist in communication electronics with a major in information technology (\"Kommunikationselektroniker, Fachrichtung Informationstechnik\"). He subsequently earned the \"Abitur\" and began studies in computer science at the Technical University of Applied Sciences of Berlin.\nDuring his studies, Floricic attended an internship with a company developing electronic security systems. In the winter term 1997/1998, Floricic successfully finished his studies and published his diploma thesis, in which he developed and described the \"Cryptophon\", an ISDN telephone with built-in voice encryption. Since parts of this work, which were to be provided by another student, were missing, he could not finish his work on the Cryptophon. His thesis, however, was rated as exceptional by the evaluating university professor. After graduation, Floricic applied for work, but was unsuccessful. In his spare time he continued, among other activities, his work on the Cryptophon.\nInterests.\nFloricic was highly interested in electronics and security systems of all kinds. He engaged in, amongst other things, attacks against the German phonecard and Pay TV systems. As part of his research he exchanged ideas and proposals with other hackers and scientists. On the mailing list \"tv-crypt\", operated by a closed group of Pay TV hackers, Floricic reported about himself in 1995 that his interests were microprocessors, programming languages, electronics of all kinds, digital radio data transmission and especially breaking the security of systems perceived as secure. He claimed to have created working clones of a chipcard used for British Pay TV and would continue his work to defeat the security of the Nagravision/Syster scrambling system which was then used by the German Pay TV provider \"PREMIERE\".\nLater, American scientists outlined a theoretical attack against SIM cards used for GSM mobile phones. Together with hackers from the Chaos Computer Club, Floricic successfully created a working clone of such a SIM card, thus showing the practicability of the attack. He also engaged in cloning the German phonecard and succeeded. While Floricic only wanted to demonstrate the insecurity of the system, the proven insecurity was also abused by criminals which led to the attention of law enforcement agencies and the German national phone operator Deutsche Telekom. After Deutsche Telekom changed the system, Floricic tried to remove a complete public card phone from a booth by force (using a sledgehammer) on 3 March 1995 in order to, as he told, adapt his phonecard simulators to the latest changes. He and a friend were, however, caught by the police upon this attempt. Floricic was later sentenced to a prison term of 15 months which was suspended to probation.\nCryptophon.\n\"Cryptophon\" (or \"Cryptofon\") was the name Floricic chose for his prototype of an ISDN telephone with integrated voice encryption. It was created in the winter term 1997\u20131998 as part of his diploma thesis, titled \"Realisierung einer Verschl\u00fcsselungstechnik f\u00fcr Daten im ISDN B-Kanal\" (German, meaning, \"Implementation of Cryptography for Data contained in the ISDN Bearer channel\"), at the Technische Fachhochschule Berlin. Floricic focused on making the Cryptophon cheap and easy to build for hobbyists. The phone encrypts telephone calls using the symmetric encryption algorithm IDEA. As IDEA is patented, the cipher was implemented on a replaceable daughter module which would have allowed the user to exchange IDEA for another (probably patent-unencumbered) algorithm. In addition, the system was about to be supplemented with a key exchange protocol based on the asymmetric algorithm RSA in order to achieve security against compromised remote stations.\nThe Cryptophon is built on the foundation of an 8051 compatible microprocessor which controls the whole system and peripherals (e.g. ISDN controller, keypad and display). For the cryptography, Floricic used cheap DSPs from Texas Instruments which he scrapped out of old computer modems, but which could also be bought at affordable prices. As this type of DSP is not powerful enough for the cryptography algorithm chosen, Floricic used two of them for the Cryptophon \u2013 one for sending and one for receiving. He planned to extend the phone so it would also be possible to encrypt data-connections. Floricic developed both the operating software of the phone as well as the cryptography implementation in the DSPs. He found a new way to implement IDEA to save significant processing time.\nDeath.\nFloricic disappeared on 17 October 1998 and was found dead in a local park in Britz in the Neuk\u00f6lln district of Berlin on 22 October after being hanged from a waistbelt wrapped around his neck. The cause of death was officially recorded as suicide. Some of his peers in the Chaos Computer Club, as well as his family members and some outside critics, have been vocal in their assertions that Floricic may have been murdered. It is argued that his activities in the areas of Pay TV cracking and voice scrambling might have disturbed the affairs of an intelligence agency or organized crime enough to provide a motive.\nThe German journalist Burkhard Schr\u00f6der published a book about the death titled \"Tron \u2013 Tod eines Hackers\" (\"Tron \u2013 Death of a Hacker\") in 1999 in which he presents the facts about the case known at the time. Because he concludes that Floricic took his own life, the author was harshly criticized by both members of the Chaos Computer Club and Floricic's parents.\nNaming controversy.\nAs Floricic's family did not wish his full name (Boris Floricic) to be used, many German newspapers referred to him as \"Boris F.\" On 14 December 2005, his parents obtained a temporary restraining order in a Berlin court against Wikimedia Foundation Inc. because its freely editable online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, mentioned the full name in its German language version. The order prohibited the Foundation from mentioning the full name on any website under the domain \"wikipedia.org\". It furthermore required the Foundation to name a representative in Germany within two weeks following the decision.\nThis was widely reported in the Dutch and German press. The initial order was mistakenly addressed to Saint Petersburg, Russia rather than to St. Petersburg, Florida, United States; this was corrected five days later. \nOn 17 January 2006, a second preliminary injunction from a court in Berlin prohibited the Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. local chapter from linking to the German Wikipedia, resulting in the change of the wikipedia.de address from a link to German Wikipedia to a page explaining the situation, although the page did not mention Tron. Despite media reports to the contrary, the German Wikipedia itself was never closed or made inaccessible in Germany. Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. confirmed to the Internet news site golem.de that the new injunction was related to the prior case against the Wikimedia Foundation and was issued on behalf of the same plaintiffs. Wikimedia Deutschland e.V. was reported as intending to fight the injunction, arguing that no valid case was presented and the freedom of the press must be defended.\nAs M\u00fcller-Maguhn, one of the spokespersons of the Chaos Computer Club, was deeply involved in the case on the side of the plaintiffs, some media reported this as a case of Chaos Computer Club against Wikipedia. The Chaos Computer Club had issued a public statement that this was a case between a few of its members and Wikipedia, and that the CCC itself did not take any position in the matter.\nThe Austrian online magazine \"Futurezone\" interviewed Andy M\u00fcller-Maguhn on 19 January 2006 about the case and its background. Maguhn admitted that the true reason behind the incident was a fictitious work recently published by a German author in which the main character had the same (civil) name as Floricic. The parents sent a protest to the publisher but were turned down with the argument that the German Wikipedia was using the name as well. M\u00fcller-Maguhn then asked the German Wikipedia to remove the name, but was turned down for a number of reasons, including failure to present proof that he was entitled to speak and act on behalf of the parents.\nOn 9 February 2006, the injunction against Wikimedia Deutschland was overturned. The plaintiffs appealed to the Berlin state court, but were turned down in May 2006."}

During World War II, Brode worked at Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, where he helped develop the proximity fuse, and then as a group leader at the Los Alamos Laboratory. In 1950 he was one of a dozen prominent scientists who petitioned President Harry S. Truman to declare that the United States would never be the first to use the hydrogen bomb.\nAfter the war, Brode returned to teaching at Berkeley. Between 1930 and 1957 he supervised 37 graduate students. In addition to his research and teaching, he occupied a number of other positions. He was the academic assistant to two presidents of the University of California, and sat on numerous advisory panels and boards.\nEarly life and education.\nRobert Bigham Brode was born in Walla Walla, Washington, on June 12, 1900, the son of Howard S. Brode, a professor of biology at Whitman College, and his wife Martha Catherine n\u00e9e Bigham. He was the second of a set of quadruplets, being born between his brothers Wallace and Malcolm; the fourth child died within weeks of birth. They had an older brother, James Stanley. All four attended Whitman College, and went on to earn doctorates and have distinguished careers as scientists and academics.\nBrode graduated from Whitman College with his Bachelor of Science degree in 1921, and then entered the California Institute of Technology. He was awarded his Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in physics in 1924, the first year in which Caltech awarded this degree, for his thesis on \"the absorption coefficient for slow electrons in gases\". He showed that molecules with similar arrangements of their external electrons have similar cross sections for collisions with slow electrons. These results could not be readily explained with classical physics, and their importance would not be realised until 1966.\nOn graduation, Brode became an Associate Physicist at the National Bureau of Standards. He was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship to study at Oriel College, Oxford, in England in 1924 and 1925, and then a National Research Council Fellowship to the University of G\u00f6ttingen in Germany in 1925 and 1926, and then a research appointment at Princeton University from 1926 to 1927. On returning to the US he married Bernice Hedley Bidwell on September 16, 1926. They had two sons.\nBrode became an assistant professor of physics at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1927, and a full professor in 1932. He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which enabled him to return to England and study at Cambridge University and Birkbeck College, University of London, in 1934 and 1935. While there, he became friends with British physicist P.M.S. Blackett. He was impressed by Blackett's cloud chambers, and set his graduate students to work on projects using them, starting with Dale R. Corson.\nManhattan Project.\nIn 1941, after the start of World War II, Brode went to work at Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University, where he helped develop the proximity fuse. In 1943, he moved with his family to the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, where he was appointed the leader of the E-3 Fusing Group. His wife Bernice was also hired to work at Los Alamos as a human computer in the T (Theoretical) Division. Brode's group consisted of 14 civilians, 12 military officers and 37 enlisted men of the Special Engineer Detachment. Its task was to develop a fuse that would detonate an atomic bomb at a specified height above the ground. \nNormally, bombs are cheap and fuses are relatively expensive, but an atomic bomb is extremely expensive, and any failure of a triggering device is unacceptable. On the other hand, for the same reason, fuses can be employed that would be prohibitively expensive in a conventional bomb. Brode's E-3 group were tasked to develop a fusing mechanism that would have less than one chance in 10,000 of failing to detonate within of the required height. The required height was not initially known, as it depended on the yield, which was uncertain. The group investigated both radar proximity fuses and barometric altimeter fuses. Testing was carried out at the Naval Proving Ground in Dahlgren, Virginia in August 1943 and Muroc Army Air Field in March 1944 using dummy drops from barrage balloons. In the end, a modified APS-13 Monica tail warning radar known as \"Archie\" was employed, and the fuses performed flawlessly in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\nLater life.\nAfter the war, Brode returned to teaching at Berkeley. In 1950 he was one of a dozen prominent scientists who petitioned President Harry S. Truman to declare that the United States would never be the first to use the hydrogen bomb. In 1951 he returned to England for another year, this time at Manchester University as a Fulbright Scholar. Between 1930 and 1943, 15 graduate students conducted their research under his direction. He supervised another 22 between 1946 and 1957. The 37 students included Corson, who became president of Cornell University, and William B. Fretter, who was vice president of the University of California from 1978 to 1983.\nIn addition to his research and teaching, Brode occupied a number of other positions. He was the academic assistant to two presidents of the University of California, Clark Kerr from 1960 to 1965, and Charles J. Hitch from 1972 to 1973, and to Angus E. Taylor, the vice-president for academic affairs, from 1967 to 1972. He served on the selection panels for Rhodes, Fulbright and Kennedy scholarships, and for awards from the State Department, the Atomic Energy Commission and the Institute of International Education. He was chairman of the Advisory Board of the Naval Ordnance Test Station from 1948 to 1955, a member of the National Research Council Committee on Data for Science and Technology (CODATA) from 1951 to 1957, and chairman of the American Association of Physics Teachers and the American Institute of Physics' Committee on Physics Faculties in Colleges from 1962 to 1965.\nAt various times Brode was vice president of the International Union for Pure and Applied Physics and the American Association of University Professors, a member of the Council of the American Physical Society, president of the Pacific Division of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, chairman of the Physics Division of the National Research Council, associate director for research of the National Science Foundation, and the U.S. delegate to the International Council of Scientific Unions.

Previously, he also served in the Pacific Theater, as quartermaster, working to \"infuse vigor into all supply activities in Australia\".\nEarly career and World War I.\nArthur R. Wilson was born on July 18, 1894 in Cherokee, California as the son of Alexander Moffatt and Agnes Matilda Wilson. He attended grammar school in Cherokee and subsequently enrolled at Oroville Union High School. Following the graduation in summer 1913, Wilson entered the University of California at Berkeley and also enlisted the California National Guard.\nWilson rose through the ranks from Private to Sergeant and left the University in June 1916, when his regiment was called for the federal service during Pancho Villa Expedition. He was ordered to the Mexican Border with 2nd California National Guard Infantry Regiment and was promoted to the rank of Quartermaster Sergeant. Wilson's unit was deactivated by the end of September 1916 and he returned to the civilian life.\nFollowing the American entry into World War I in April 1917, Wilson entered the Army service and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Field Artillery Branch on August 15, 1917. He was ordered to the Presidio of San Francisco and attached to the 386th Field Artillery Regiment. Wilson completed basic training and moved with the regiment to Camp Lewis, Washington, D.C. in September 1917. He was promoted to the temporary rank of first lieutenant on April 11, 1918 and embarked for France in June that year. He was meanwhile promoted to the temporary rank of captain on May 24, 1918 and was stationed at Camp de Souge, where he participated in the training of replacement units.\nUpon the signing of the Armistice with Germany in November 1918, he participated in the occupation of the Rhineland, Germany until February 1919, when his regiment was ordered back to the United States.\nInterwar period.\nFollowing his return to the United States, Wilson remained in the Army and was stationed at Fort Collins, Colorado. He was allowed to complete his education at the University of California and graduated with Bachelor of Arts degree in May 1919. Wilson then assumed duty as Professor of Military Science and Tactics at Colorado Agricultural College and remained in that capacity until October that year, when he was sent to Fort Sill, Oklahoma for duty with 9th Field Artillery Regiment.\nOn July 1, 1920, Wilson was transferred to the Regular Army and commissioned first lieutenant and Captain on the same day. While at Fort Sill, he entered the Army Field Artillery School in September 1921 and following the graduation in June of the following year. Wilson then moved to Columbia, Missouri, where he assumed duty as a Professor of Military Science and Tactics at University of Missouri.\nHis tenure there ended in September 1926 and joined 76th Field Artillery Regiment at the Presidio of Monterey, California and remained until March 1928, when he was sent to the Schofield Barracks, Hawaii for service with 13th Field Artillery Regiment.\nIn December 1930, Wilson returned stateside and joined the headquarters of Experimental Mechanized Force at Fort Eustis, Virginia under Brigadier general Daniel Van Voorhis as Publicity Officer. The mission of the Force was to conduct experiments in armored warfare and test experimental armored equipment. The attached subordinate units came under the control of the Mechanized Force for specific training events related to the testing of equipment or tactics and Wilson was in the frequent contact with the press.\nWilson moved to Fort Knox, Kentucky and became Post Adjutant in November 1931 and remained in that capacity until August 1932, when he was ordered to the Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas and graduated from the two-year course in June 1934. Wilson was then sent to the Army War College in Washington, D.C., where he completed advanced course in June 1935. He then attended the Chemical Warfare School at Edgewood Arsenal, Maryland and following the graduation on August 1, 1935, he was promoted to major.\nHe then served as an instructor at the Army Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth until July 1937, when he was sent to the War Department General Staff in Washington, D.C. for duty as Liaison officer with the Works Progress Administration, a New Deal agency, employing millions of job-seekers (mostly unskilled men) to carry out public works projects, including the construction of public buildings and roads.\nWilson was appointed Chief of the Works Projects Administration Branch at the Supply Division, War Department General Staff in September 1939 and remained in that capacity until January 1940, when he resumed his previous duty as Liaison officer with the War Department General Staff. He was appointed Chief of the Federal Works Agency Branch within the Supply Division in June 1940 and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on August 18 of that year. While in this capacity, Wilson was given additional duty as Liaison officer with the Truman Committee under then-Senator Harry S. Truman, which was formed in March 1941 to find and correct problems in U.S. war production with waste, inefficiency, and war profiteering.\nWorld War II.\nFollowing the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor, Wilson was promoted to the temporary rank of colonel on December 24, 1941 and ordered back to the War Department General Staff. He was promoted to the temporary rank of brigadier general on January 22, 1942 and sailed with the first waves of American troops to the Southwest Pacific. As quartermaster general, South West Pacific Area Command, he assisted in working out a vital lend-lease agreement with the top officials of the Australian government.\nWilson returned to the United States in June 1942 and then embarked for Europe as Commanding general, Services of Supply, Western Task Force. He held that assignment during the Operation Torch, an Anglo\u2013American invasion of French North Africa in November 1942 and was responsible for the administration of the Corps of Engineers, Signal Corps, Ordnance Department, Quartermaster Corps, Chemical Corps, Medical Corps and the Transportation Corps.\nBy the beginning of January 1943, Wilson was appointed Commanding General, Atlantic &amp; Mediterranean Base Sections, U.S. North African Theater of Operations and was responsible for the administration of supplies during the combat operations in that areas and held that command during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July\u2013August 1943. Wilson was decorated with Legion of Merit for his service in 1942\u20131943. He was promoted to the temporary rank of major general on January 13, 1944.\nIn July 1944, Wilson was based in Naples, Italy as commanding general, Coastal Base Section, which accompanied the Seventh Army on 15 August 1944 during Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of Southern France. For the first three weeks Coastal Base Section was largely occupied with the operation of the landing beaches. Wilson also transformed Naples into the major supply center on the Italian mainland and did the similar work in two other ports. In doing so these three port communities were rehabilitated in record-breaking time, earning the gratitude and appreciation of the people and government of liberated Italy.\nWilson's work was appreciated by the Italian Government and he was decorated with the Order of the Crown of Italy and the University of Naples awarded him an honorary degree of doctor of laws. The City of Naples conferred honorary citizenship upon him and he was also elected a Cavalier Magistrate, Order of the Knights of Malta, in connection with these recognition's of his significant part in helping to restore the life and culture of Free Italy. For his service in that capacity, Wilson received Army Distinguished Service Medal.\nGeneral Wilson was appointed Chief of Staff, Seventh Army under lieutenant general Alexander Patch in November 1944 and participated in the Ardennes-Alsace and Central Europe operations. Wilson distinguished himself again in this capacity and received second Army Distinguished Service Medal and Bronze Star Medal. He was also decorated with the Legion of Honour, Croix de Guerre with Palm by the Government of France or Order of the British Empire.\nIn 1945 he was conferred the Freedom of the City of Dijon.\nPostwar service and retirement.\nWilson returned to the United States in July 1945 and joined the War Department General Staff in Washington, D.C. as a member of the Committee on National Guard and Reserve Policies.

He played college football at the University of Toledo, and still held the school record for rushing yards in a single season, with 1,162, as of 2013.\nCole was born in Illinois and grew up in Swanton, Ohio, where he was a standout athlete in high school. He attended Toledo on an athletic scholarship and was a mainstay on the football team between 1947 and 1949, setting several school records. The Browns selected him late in the 1950 NFL draft, and groomed him as the replacement for Marion Motley. Cole ran for more than 100 yards in 1950, when the Browns won the NFL championship, and saw his playing time increase the following year after Motely was injured. He was cut, however, in 1952 after coming into conflict with head coach Paul Brown.\nAfter a short stint with the Chicago Bears, Cole retired from football and became a deputy sheriff back in Ohio. He later held jobs with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, including as the statewide compliance director. He retired in 1986. Cole was inducted into Toledo's athletics hall of fame in 1984.\nEarly life and college.\nCole was born in Carrier Mills, Illinois, where his father worked as a miner. His family shuttled back and forth between Illinois and Toledo, Ohio when he was a child as his father got seasonal work in mines and at a foundry in Toledo. They bought a farm and settled in Swanton, Ohio, a small town near Toledo, in 1938. Cole attended the local Swanton High School, where he played football and baseball and ran track. He became the starting tailback in his sophomore year and played on the team for three seasons. He was named the team's Most Valuable Player once.\nAfter graduating in 1946, Cole attended the University of Toledo on an athletic scholarship. Playing for Toledo's football team between 1947 and 1949, he had 2,300 rushing yards as a fullback and 33 rushing touchdowns. As of 2013, he holds the Toledo Rockets single-season rushing record, with 1,162 yards, and is second in career touchdowns and touchdowns in a season. Cole was named a first-team All-Ohio player in his senior year and was an honorable mention All-American.\nProfessional career.\nThe Cleveland Browns of the National Football League (NFL) selected Cole in the later rounds of the 1950 draft, making him the first African-American player selected by the Browns since joining the league that year. The Browns had four other black players on their roster, including fullback Marion Motley, linebacker Bill Willis and punter Horace Gillom, but they had all joined the team during its years in the defunct All-America Football Conference.\nCleveland head coach Paul Brown groomed Cole to replace Motley, who was nearing the end of his career in 1950. Cole played in all 12 of the team's games that year, running for 105 yards on 26 carries. He was also used as a linebacker on defense. The Browns finished the regular season with a 10\u20132 win\u2013loss record and beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the NFL championship.\nWhile Cole appeared to be Motley's chosen successor at fullback in an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham and ends Mac Speedie and Dante Lavelli, his relationship with Brown was strained. Cole felt that Brown did not like that he challenged his authority and refused to submit to his authoritarian coaching style. Cole saw his carries increase in 1951, when Motley was injured. The Browns again made the championship game that year but lost to the Rams. Brown cut Cole during the following season, and he spent the remainder of the year with the Chicago Bears before leaving football. Cleveland halfback Dub Jones later criticized Brown's handling of Cole, calling it the biggest waste of talent he had ever seen.\nLike other black players of his era, Cole frequently endured racist taunts on the field and racial discrimination off the field. Black players typically stayed in separate hotels from the white players, and the groups did not mingle socially. White players on opposing teams stepped on the black players after plays were over; they often stepped on Motley's hands and once stepped hard on Cole's face, cutting his mouth. Brown did not tolerate racism within the team, but Cole later said he thought Brown considered black athletes to be physically superior but intellectually inferior to whites.\nLater life.\nFollowing his playing career, Cole went back to Ohio and took a $2,000-a-year job as a deputy in the Lucas County sheriff's department. After having trouble getting promoted because of racial discrimination, he left for a job in the county welfare department and later in its anti-poverty department. He later got a job in Toledo as the regional director of the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, a body that oversees enforcement of anti-discrimination laws. He spent nine years there before being promoted to the commission's statewide compliance director in Columbus, Ohio. He retired in 1986. Cole was inducted into the University of Toledo Varsity T Club Hall of Fame in 1984. He is also a member of Swanton High School's hall of fame.\nHe died on 4 June 2019, at the age of 91."}

She is the oldest of five children born to Mary (n\u00e9e Gilligan) and Max Warren. On her mother's side she is a descendant of Francis Gilligan, an Irishman who was transported to Australia as a convict under the Whiteboy Acts.\nWicks grew up in Canberra and country New South Wales where her father worked as a schoolteacher. She lived for periods in Cowra and Walcha, before the family settled in Point Clare on the Central Coast. She attended the Gosford Christian Community School in Narara where her father was the principal. Wicks holds the degree of Bachelor of Arts (Hons.) in English literature from the University of Sydney. After graduating she returned to Gosford Christian Community School as a teacher from 1996 to 1998.\nFrom 1999 to 2003 Wicks worked as a Liberal Party staffer and electorate officer. She later worked in corporate affairs and communications for Telstra from 2004 to 2011, and as a government relations adviser from 2011 to 2012.

She later served as president of the state women's council and state vice-president in the Liberal Party of Australia (New South Wales Division) from 2011 to 2012.\nWicks is a member of the Centre-Right faction of the Liberal Party.\nParliament.\nWicks was appointed as the Liberal candidate for the federal seat of Robertson in 2012. The state executive chose not to hold a preselection for the seat in order to \"overcome entrenched local factions\", with Wicks reportedly endorsed by opposition leader Tony Abbott. As a result some local members refused to campaign for her. Wicks was nonetheless elected to the House of Representatives at the 2013 federal election, defeating the incumbent Australian Labor Party (ALP) member Deborah O'Neill.\nWicks was appointed to the speaker's panel in February 2015.

He has been a Nationals member of the House of Representatives since 2013, representing the Division of Lyne in New South Wales. He is currently the Minister for Regional Health and has previously served as an assistant minister in the Turnbull Government from 2016 to 2018, serving as Assistant Minister for Rural Health (2016\u20132017), Assistant Minister for Health (2017) and Assistant Minister for Children and Families (2017\u20132018).\nEarly life.\nGillespie was born in Canberra and educated at Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview. He was a gastroenterologist for twenty years and, up until the 2013 election, was the director of physician training at Port Macquarie Base Hospital.\nPolitics.\nGillespie contested the seat of Lyne for the first time in 2010. While he lost to the incumbent, National-turned-independent Rob Oakeshott, the Nationals picked up an 11-point swing. Following Oakeshott's retirement at the 2013 federal election, Gillespie contested the seat again and won it resoundingly. During Oakeshott's tenure, Lyne remained a comfortably safe National seat in a traditional two-party matchup with Labor, so it had been expected that the seat would revert to the Nationals once Oakeshott retired.\nTurnbull Government.\nAfter the re-election of the Turnbull Government at the 2016 federal election, Gillespie was appointed Assistant Minister for Rural Health in the a ministerial reshuffle. He was promoted to Assistant Minister for Health in a subsequent rearrangement of the ministry in January 2017. Gillespie has argued for politicians who represent electorates larger than 10,000 square kilometres (such as his own) to receive additional expenses.\nIn February 2018, Gillespie was briefly a candidate to replace Barnaby Joyce as National Party leader. After finding a lack of support for his candidacy within the party room, he withdrew from the race and endorsed Michael McCormack, the only other announced candidate.\nGillespie was not retained in the ministry when Scott Morrison replaced Turnbull as prime minister in August 2018. He said he was \"disappointed but it is a very competitive space, and the reshuffle is a reflection of how much talent we have\". He also stated that \"the general electorate was pretty disgusted with all the factional wars that we saw played out in public\".\nMorrison Government.\nFollowing the resignation of Bridget McKenzie, Gillespie stood unsuccessfully for the deputy leadership of the National Party in February 2020. He was defeated by David Littleproud, with Keith Pitt also running. In the lead-up to the vote, he criticised party leader Michael McCormack's lack of engagement with the national media. McCormack defeated Barnaby Joyce in a leadership ballot, and Gillespie subsequently stated that \"the leader has our full support\" and that another challenge to McCormack's leadership was unlikely. In 2021, Barnaby Joyce successfully challenged McCormack for the leadership of the National Party.\nIn the cabinet reshuffle in late June 2021, he was appointed as the Minister for Regional Health.\nParliamentary eligibility.\nGillespie came under scrutiny after the High Court ruling in the Bob Day case. In April 2017, the High Court found that, under section 44(v) of the Australian Constitution, Senator Bob Day had not been eligible to hold public office because of an indirect pecuniary relationship with the Australian government. The Australian Labor Party (ALP) opposition and some community groups believe that Gillespie also has an indirect financial relationship with the federal government, in that he owns a suburban shopping complex in Port Macquarie which leases a premises to an Australia Post licensee. In July 2017, the ALP launched a High Court challenge to Gillespie's eligibility as an MP. The case was formally brought by Peter Alley, the ALP candidate for Gillespie's seat of Lyne at the 2016 federal election. Gillespie sold his interest in the shopping complex in early 2018, which would ensure his eligibility in a by-election if the court ruled that he was ineligible at the time of the 2016 election. On 21 March 2018 the seven members of the High Court determined unanimously that it does not have the jurisdiction to hear the case, unless this matter is referred to it by parliament.\nPersonal.\nGillespie is married to Charlotte, and they have three children. The family lives at Sancrox, west of Port Macquarie. He is a Roman Catholic."}

He resigned from the position in August 2018 following the election of Scott Morrison in a Liberal Party Leadership spill.\nFringe benefits tax.\nAs a candidate during the 2013 federal election campaign, Laundy argued that the removal of the fringe benefits tax concession on motor vehicles would be \"another kick in the pants to Australia's automotive industry.\"\nAustralian Broadcasting Corporation.\nIn January 2014, public broadcaster, the ABC received criticism from senior members of the Coalition government, including the Defence Minister, David Johnston and the Prime Minister Tony Abbott, who said that he feels that sometimes the ABC acts in a way that \"instinctively takes everyone's side but Australia's.\" Laundy defended the ABC, responding that he does not defend their content, but their right to \"say what they want.\" He said that \"the beauty of living in a democracy is that if you don't like what you're hearing, what you're watching, or what you're looking at on the internet, choose another channel.\" He also said that it is not the role of the ABC to be patriotic.\nRacial discrimination.\nIn March 2014, the Attorney-General George Brandis proposed draft legislative amendments to the Racial Discrimination Act, 1975, seeking to remove sections that made it unlawful \"to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people\" on the basis of their \"race, colour or national or ethnic origin.\" Laundy, a Liberal backbencher at the time, spoke out against the changes, saying that it was \"important that we support a legislative system that reflects the diverse and multicultural country that modern Australia has become today.\" The changes were dropped after widespread public outrage, and opposition from some Liberal backbenchers, including Laundy, Phillip Ruddock, and Ken Wyatt, an indigenous Member of Parliament.\nOn 3 October 2014, Laundy joined with Labor MPs Tony Burke, Anthony Albanese, and Michelle Rowland in supporting the #NotinMyName campaign, which condemns racism, hatred, and bigotry.\nPalestine.\nLaundy is co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine Group. On 5 June 2014, the Abbott Government announced the term \"occupied\" would no longer be used to describe East Jerusalem. Laundy publicly opposed the shift in language, saying that the area was occupied by armed Israeli forces.\nSame-sex marriage.\nLaundy does not support same-sex marriage, but had previously supported a conscience vote on the issue. In September 2014, he declared that he no longer supported a free vote. After his constituency voted in favour of same-sex marriage in the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, Laundy voted for the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017, which legalised same-sex marriage in Australia.\nIn 2015, pro same-sex marriage activists sent unmarked letters filled with glitter to the offices of several Federal Coalition MPs. Laundy's office was briefly locked down until police determined the packages were harmless, and the activist group GetUp! issued an official apology for the stunt. Laundy labelled it a grossly irresponsible act, noting that to 'send any undeclared substance through the mail to the office of a Member of Parliament will inevitably cause alarm'.\nRefugee intake.\nIn 2015 Laundy was shown photographs of a dead Syrian toddler fleeing the Syrian civil war by his daughter at the dinner table, which brought him and the rest of his family to tears. Moved by the images and the unfolding crisis, Laundy called the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Julie Bishop, and Immigration and Border Protection, Peter Dutton, canvassing an increase in the humanitarian refugee intake by Australia, especially in relation to refugees from Syria. Speaking to the media afterwards about the decision to seek asylum in the face of intense suffering and persecution, Laundy drew parallels between refugees and all of humanity, saying: \"There but for the grace of God go any of us. Put yourself in the position of those people and tell me you wouldn\u2019t do the same.\" Laundy was subsequently appointed as the Assistant Minister for Multicultural Affairs."}

{"name": "Katharine Hayhoe", "type": "person", "abstract": "Katharine Anne Scott Hayhoe (born 1972) is a Canadian atmospheric scientist and professor of political science at Texas Tech University, where she is director of the Climate Science Center.", "wikipage": "Katharine Anne Scott Hayhoe (born 1972) is a Canadian atmospheric scientist and professor of political science at Texas Tech University, where she is director of the Climate Science Center. She is also the chief executive officer of the consulting firm ATMOS Research and Consulting. In 2021, Hayhoe joined the Nature Conservancy as Chief Scientist for the organization. \nEarly life and education.\nHayhoe was born on April 15, 1972, in Toronto, Ontario. Her father, Doug Hayhoe, was a science educator and missionary. When Hayhoe was nine, her family moved to Cali, Colombia, where her parents served as missionaries and educators.\nHayhoe received her Bachelor of Science degree in physics and astronomy from the University of Toronto in 1994. She began her college career studying astrophysics, but upon taking a course on climate science to fulfill a course requirement, she shifted her focus to atmospheric science, which she ultimately specialized in at graduate school. She attended graduate school University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where she received her Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy. Her PhD committee was chaired by Donald Wuebbles, who recruited her for a research project assessing the health of the Great Lakes. Wuebbles also introduced her to the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit science advocacy organization.\nPersonal life.\nHayhoe, who is an evangelical Christian, is the daughter of missionaries. She has stated that admitting her life as a Christian and a scientist is \"like coming out of the closet\". Her father, Doug Hayhoe, is a former science and technology coordinator for the Toronto District School Board, and is currently an associate professor of education at Tyndale University College and Seminary in Toronto. Hayhoe credits her father as an inspiration with regard to her belief that science and religion do not have to conflict with one another.\nShe met her husband, Andrew Farley, while doing graduate studies at the University of Illinois. Farley is an Associate Professor of Applied Linguistics at Texas Tech University., and the Lead Pastor of Church Without Religion, an evangelical church in Lubbock, Texas.\nResearch career.\nHayhoe has worked at Texas Tech since 2005. She has authored more than 120 peer-reviewed publications. She also co-authored some reports for the US Global Change Research Program, as well as some National Academy of Sciences reports, including the third National Climate Assessment, released on May 6, 2014. Shortly after the report was released, Hayhoe said, \"Climate change is here and now, and not in some distant time or place,\" adding that, \"The choices we're making today will have a significant impact on our future.\" She has also served as an expert reviewer for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report.\nOn September 16, 2019, Hayhoe was named one of the United Nations Champions of the Earth in the science and innovation category.\nClimate communications.\nIn addition to her research on climate change, Hayhoe is known for her communication around climate change and her advocacy efforts around climate action. Professor John Abraham has called her \"perhaps the best communicator on climate change.\" \"Time\" magazine listed her among the 100 most influential people in 2014. In 2014, the American Geophysical Union awarded her its climate communications award. Hayhoe has also appeared at the White House with former President Barack Obama and the actor Leonardo DiCaprio at the first South by South Lawn festival.\nHayhoe has been very critical of Climate Deniers. On September 28, 2018, she said, \"The six stages of climate denial are: It's not real. It's not us. It's not that bad. It's too expensive to fix. Aha, here's a great solution (that actually does nothing). And\u00a0\u2013 oh no! Now it's too late. You really should have warned us earlier.\"\nOutreach to Christian communities.\nIn 2009, she and her husband, Andrew Farley, co-authored a book called \"A Climate for Change: Global Warming Facts for Faith-Based Decisions\", which outlines the ways in which climate science reflects conservative Christian beliefs. The book resulted in word-of-mouth referrals across various Christian communities, who began to invite Hayhoe to speak at Christian colleges, churches, and other conservative groups. Notably, when Hayhoe first met her husband and co-author, he was skeptical of global warming, but shifted his views. She notes that she was able to change his mind over the course of a year and a half, with the help of data collected on a NASA website that documents rising global temperatures over time. Hayhoe has recognized that those debates with her husband sharpened her skills as a communicator engaging audiences skeptical of climate science.\nThe effectiveness of her outreach efforts to Christian communities have been the subject of study. She delivers lectures that are rooted in scripture and focus on the benefits of collective action to mitigate the effects of climate change. A 2017 study tested the effectiveness of a climate lecture Hayhoe delivered to students at the predominantly evangelical school Houghton College, in which she devoted time to a discussion of theology-based ethics and delivered information about climate change through a lens of evangelical tradition. Following her lecture, students exhibited more willingness to accept that global warming is a true phenomenon and had an increased awareness of the expert scientific consensus. In an interview with ThinkProgress, Hayhoe notes: \"When we tie that to our Christian values there\u2019s no conflict. In fact, quite the opposite\u00a0\u2013\u200aour faith demands that we act on this issue.\"\nTelevision and video.\nIn 2014, Hayhoe served as a science advisor to the documentary TV series \"Years of Living Dangerously\", an Emmy Award\u2013winning Showtime series that details how climate change has already impacted lives around the world. She was featured in the first episode of the series, meeting with actor Don Cheadle to discuss why she believed her Christian faith and her belief in the need to act on climate were not at odds.\nHayhoe also hosted and produced a bi-weekly web series with PBS called \"Global Weirding: Climate, Politics, and Religion\", which launched September 2016 and ran through March 2019.\nNewt Gingrich book.\nHayhoe wrote a chapter of a book by Newt Gingrich about climate change in 2009, and, in 2011, was told by Gingrich's co-author, Terry Maple, that it had been accepted. Gingrich announced in late 2011 that this chapter was dropped on his request, saying, \"We didn't know that they were doing that, and we told them to kill it.\"\nUpon finding out that her chapter had been dropped, Hayhoe stated, \"I had not heard that\" and tweeted that she had spent over 100 unpaid hours working on the chapter. Some have speculated that Gingrich dropped her chapter because Marc Morano, who is not a scientist, wrote many articles on his website, \"Climate Depot\", attacking her findings. This, as well as her appearing on Bill O'Reilly's TV show, led to her receiving nearly 200 hate-mail messages the following day. Shortly after, the conservative political action committee American Tradition Institute filed a request under the Freedom of Information Act for Hayhoe's public university employer to release her notes and emails related to the writing of the unpublished chapter for the Gingrich book.\nExternal links.\n[[Category:1972 births]]\n[[Category:21st-century Canadian scientists]]\n[[Category:21st-century Canadian women scientists]]\n[[Category:21st-century Protestants]]\n[[Category:Canadian atmospheric scientists]]\n[[Category:Canadian emigrants to the United States]]\n[[Category:Canadian evangelicals]]\n[[Category:Canadian political scientists]]\n[[Category:Canadian women scientists]]\n[[Category:Christian scholars]]\n[[Category:Climate communication]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Science communicators]]\n[[Category:Scientists from Toronto]]\n[[Category:Texas Tech University faculty]]\n[[Category:University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign alumni]]\n[[Category:Women atmospheric scientists]]\n[[Category:Women political scientists]]"}

Maria holds the Louis and Annette Kaufman Composition Chair; and the Joachim Chassman Violin Chair at the Montgomery Arts House for Music and Architecture in Malibu, California, and is a founder of the Malibu Friends of Music. Her library of original works represents a range of genres, from large-scale orchestral works, works for the ballet, chamber works, choral and vocal works, to new collaborative scores for vintage silent film. She has been presented with many awards and commissions, including musical commendations from the United States Congress (2009), the California State Senate (2009), the California State Assembly (2009), the City of Malibu (2010), and the Annenberg Foundation (2011).\nLife and career.\nThe youngest of the children of nine-time Academy Award-winning composer/conductor Alfred Newman and former Goldwyn Girl and businesswoman Martha Louis Montgomery, Maria Newman is part of the musical Hollywood Newman family dynasty. Her father, Alfred Newman, (1900-1970), was the conductor of the original Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. Her family was of Jewish background.\nNewman grew up in Pacific Palisades, California and began studying piano at age six. At age eight, she started a lifelong tie to the violin and was composing by age nine. As a teenager, Newman studied with violinist Joachim Chassman, who was a founding member of the Hollywood String Quartet, and played in the 20th Century Fox Studio Orchestra under Alfred Newman (composer).\nAfter high school, Newman entered the University of Rochester's Eastman School of Music in Rochester, NY, where she studied violin with Peter Salaff of the Cleveland Quartet, and piano with Blair Cosman, graduating in 1984, and earning a Bachelor of Music (BM '84) with high honors (Magna cum Laude). Also in 1984, Newman was inducted into the American Academic Honor Society, Pi Kappa Lambda. Newman attended Yale University from 1984 to 1986, completing graduate work there, studying violin with Syoko Aki, and composition with Martin Bresnick.

She has one half brother, Tim Newman.\nMaria is from a large family of major Hollywood film composers:\nComposition career.\nNewman is an Annenberg Foundation Composition Fellow, and received a grant from the foundation in 2012.\nAs a violinist who performs and records around the world, Maria Newman began her professional composition career using a pseudonym. \"I was terribly worried that I would not be taken seriously as a female composer in what I felt was a highly male-dominated field. My famous family's film musician genealogy also put the notion into my mind that I would not be accepted, much less respected, in the concert music world as a serious composer.\" Newman used the name, M. Louis Parker, the name of her maternal great-grandmother, feeling that the name neither indicated that she was a Newman, nor a woman. In 1991, Newman began using her own name as a composer. Newman studied composition briefly with Martin Bresnick, at Yale University, though she received both her BM and MM in Violin Performance. To date, Newman's original music library consists of over 150 concert works.\nIcicle Creek Music Center.\nIn the Summer of 1995, Newman was appointed Composer-in-Residence for the Icicle Creek Music Center in Leavenworth, Washington.

Newman has held the Louis and Annette Kaufman Composition Chair and the Joachim Chassman Violin Chair at the Montgomery Arts House for Music and Architecture (MAHMA) and the Malibu Friends of Music since 2005.\nNewman's achievement at MAHMA is the story of a dedicated classical musician, who, through perseverance, dedication and the belief that music is a highly powerful community-wide healing mechanism, is offering music and music making on an intimate level. Newman has a gift of making audiences feel valued and she effortlessly gains their trust. It is important to Newman that the musicians are happy as well. Says Newman, \"I feel that at MAHMA we are in a place where dear friends gather to rehearse, perform, listen, experience, eat, laugh, and discuss music and art in depth. The level of music-making here is extraordinarily high and truly rare for a small town, as we bring in wonderful guest artists and speakers from around the world to collaborate with our outstanding group of resident artists. The entire experience at MAHMA is marvelously satisfying.\" In addition, Newman tours frequently as featured composer, performer, lecturer and master teacher.\nAccording to critic Jim Svejda, \"Maria Newman is hugely musical, bewitching, profound and playful with an instantly recognizable and unusually appealing musical personality.\"\nViklarbo Chamber Ensemble.\nAlong with pianist/longtime musical partner, Wendy Prober, Newman founded the Viklarbo Chamber Ensemble in 1987.
